  <h1>About</h1>
  <p><img width="300" height="300" src="/assets/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/kate_bagoy_JS_0002b-s-sm.jpg" alt="Web Design for Coaches &amp; Consultants 1"></p>
  <p>Web design can feel really overwhelming if you've never built a website before or didn't study design.</p>
  <p><strong>But a website is one of the MOST important things you can build for your business if you want the freedom to work anywhere.</strong></p>
  <p>That's why I decided to start offering simple, effective website designs for coaches and consultants.</p>
  <p><strong>As a <a href="http://killerdesignforstartups.com/">UX designer</a> who's been building websites in some capacity for close to 20 years (gawd…!), I can build a website using effective design, marketing & sales principles in half the time it would take a novice.</strong></p>
  <p>And as an MBA graduate, product marketer & a business coach, <strong>I know what elements are going to be most critical for your clients and how to position YOU to shine as a business owner & make you money</strong>.</p>
  <p>While I can create fully custom sites, I find that most consultants are better served using a content management or site building system, so I create all my sites using WordPress with Divi, Squarespace, Wix or Weeby (at your discretion). This enables you to easily modify your website as your business grows.</p>
  <p><strong>If you're ashamed of your current site, haven't launched because you "can't get it right," or just don't know where to start, book a consultation today & lets get you on the path to freelance success.</strong></p>
  <h1>Versatile Layout Options</h1>
  <p>Your site will include a compelling intro, a services or solutions sections, an about section, a styled testimonial and a way to contact you or schedule an appointment and, depending on your needs, may contain an email option form, gallery, portfolio grid or case study.</p>

  <h4>Choice of Platform</h4>
  <p>I can create your site in WordPress, SquareSpace, Wix or Weebly</p>
  <p>R</p>
  <h4>Mobile Optimized</h4>
  <p>I'll make sure your site looks & work as well on a phone as a desktop</p>
  <p>R</p>
  <h4>Designed to Sell</h4>
  <p>Your website will look great and, more importantly, will be setup strategically to make you money.</p>
