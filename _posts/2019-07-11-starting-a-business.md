I took my first scooter ride today on Lyft.

A few hours later, I took an Uber scooter home.

Outside my apartment there are scooters from Bird, Lime and a handful of other companies.

_All nearly identical except for the brand._

Yep, I'm spoiled for choice when it comes to dangerous transportation methods here in Miami.

And truth be told, there is no shortage of designers, copywriters, marketing consultants coaches... You name it... Who COULD do a great job for your clients.

_**That doesn't mean there isn't room for you in the market too.**_

A lot of time I talk to clients who think there is no point starting a business because someone else has done it.

Maybe even someone better.

<Gasp>

But just because someone is better than you, or further along, doesn't mean someone out there wouldn't rather work with YOU.

?Maybe that other coach is a total dick.

?Maybe that other designer uses too many drop shadows.

?Maybe that other copywriter is too conversational for YOUR ideal client.

You get my point, right?

You, friend, are unique in all the world\*, and someone is dying to work with you.

If you're considering starting a business, don't worry so much about the \*competition,\* just worry about marketing yourself in the best light possible.

You've gotta get off your butt and find the clients that love you, and figure out how to sell them.
