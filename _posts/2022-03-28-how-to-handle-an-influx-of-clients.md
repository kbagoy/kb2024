Any business can experience times of growth and times of stagnation. And when you are experiencing growth, your first response is probably excitement. However, if you aren’t prepared for the new clients you may get overwhelmed and feel like you aren’t sure how to tackle all the projects you have on your plate. But even if you are experiencing more growth than expected, you can take steps to handle the influx of clients with ease and use it to your advantage!

## **Allocate Your Time Wisely**

The first key to handling all your new clients [is to be smart about the way you manage your time](https://www.hlpos.com/our-blog/how-to-cope-with-a-sudden-influx-of-customers/). Make sure that you don’t agree to deadlines that you can’t make, and once you have set your schedule, do your best to stick to it. You should have a general idea of how long certain jobs will take in order to get done, and you want to make sure that you are prioritizing your time as well as possible. When you manage your time well, you will be able to create a workable schedule to meet your growing company’s needs.

## **Hire Help**

You might not be able to handle all the new work you have to do without a little extra help, and that’s okay. You can hire new team members to help you to manage your time and your new clients in the best possible way. Even though you may need new workers in a hurry, you don’t want to rush the process. Make sure you do a thorough job vetting your applicants so you know that you have made solid hires. Conducting an interview [is all about asking the right questions](https://www.myqualitypayroll.com/interviewing-mistakes-you-must-avoid-when-looking-for-your-next-hire/). And if you can do that well, you will add solid members to your team.

## **Set Reasonable Expectations**

When you are in a period of growth with your business, it’s important that you have reasonable expectations. Not only just for yourself but also for your team and your new clients. [Make sure to have a solid understanding of what you can do](https://www.hlpos.com/our-blog/how-to-cope-with-a-sudden-influx-of-customers/) and how it can help you to be more successful, and don’t overstretch. When everyone is on the same page, your job will be much easier to handle. Your business deserves to see growth over time, but sometimes growth comes with challenges. It’s important that you take time to talk with your team and work together to manage your new clients. Be open and communicative to make sure that everyone is working together to meet company goals. **Read this next:**[**Technology Solutions Your Business Can’t Run Without**](https://katebagoy.com/technology-solutions-your-business-cant-run-without/)
