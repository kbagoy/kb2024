Your business should be seen and heard even after you leave the office. The power and personality of your brand can shine through in your day-to-day activities. You should be proud of your products and hard work even when you're hardly working. The truth is that no customer looks forward to an unwanted approach of someone trying to sell them products for a personal gain. Here are a few ways for**representing your brand in public** and let your creative genius speak for itself.

## Conduct

Have you ever set your heart on a product or service only to find the person selling it is truly unlikable? Conduct goes a long way when searching for potential buyers. Take your mother's advice and pay attention to your manners in public, especially when you're representing your brand. Another crucial thing business owners and employees overlook is their social media presence. It's so easy to look up a brand, and past social media posts can come back to haunt you. Consider deleting all potentially controversial posts, keeping your [personal and professional profiles separate](https://jessicaslaughter.co/blog/should-you-separate-your-blog-and-personal-social-media-accounts/), or sticking to social media solely to promote your brand.

## Appearance

No matter how formal or informal your brand is, it's important to present yourself in a good light. If you're wearing your brand of clothing in public, make sure it's clean so that people won't be afraid to approach you and ask you where you got it. Those in the beauty industry in particular need to be conscious of how they present themselves. An aesthetician might get her lashes filled [every 3 weeks](https://ilashstore.com/faq/) to keep her lashes full and better represent her beauty business. Hairdressers should keep their color fresh and style immaculate. Makeup artists should also put effort into how they do their face so they can steer curious complimenting customers right to their shop door.

On your days off, you might have a few favorite hangouts where you go to catch up with friends and unwind. By creating relationships with waitstaff, baristas and bartenders, you can promote your brand in your own comfort zone by simply being your best friendly self. Instead of pushing your brand, try friendly conversation with other patrons and the staff itself. Who knows, you might be invited to showcase your wares at their next promotional event. Your brand should represent you wherever you go. Let your new customers see what you're about both publicly and personally, and they will be more likely to join your cause. **Want to up your brand?[Get my step-by-step guide here](https://go.katebagoy.com/ebook) and start reaching your potential.**
