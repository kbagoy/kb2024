A well-run business requires efficiency, and that means completing necessary tasks quickly, effectively, and without wasting time or resources. With some complex tasks, however, reaching efficiency can be difficult, especially if you try to tackle them all yourself. It's better if you can implement strategies to make complex tasks easier for your business.

## **Outsource Them**

Outsourcing certain tasks that require specialized knowledge makes sense in terms of both finances and production. You will save time and money if you hire contractors who can do the work in a fraction of the time that you can and with better results. Two of the most commonly outsourced complex tasks involve accounting and technology. A professional accountant can save you money and [avoid potential problems by overseeing your taxes](https://www.enkel.ca/blog/bookkeeping/10-reasons-business-owners-should-consider-outsourcing-accounting/) and helping you identify waste. Outsourcing tasks involving technology, such as website development or cyber security, will ensure a more professionally-done job.

## **Rely on Software Tools**

Software tools, even those as simple as a spreadsheet, can make the most time-consuming tasks easier and more efficient. Bookkeeping software can not only keep track of transactions but quickly provide you with reports that can give you useful information in running your business. Inventory management software is a necessity if you deal in sales. Do your research before deciding on which software is right for you. There are often several apps or services that will have similar features but with a slightly different focus. Keeping your software up to date [helps improve overall security](https://www.weavertech.us/the-benefits-of-performing-regular-software-updates/).

## **Delegate Them**

Good leaders learn in a hurry: when a task is complex, break it up into steps, create a timeline, and delegate. Often, owners of small businesses fall into the trap of trying to do everything themselves. Instead, learn to trust your employees and take advantage of their strengths. Using teamwork, and delegating each specific step or responsibility to a team member, can get jobs done quickly. It will also build your employees' confidence and further develop their abilities. In the long run, [they'll feel more valued](https://www.meistertask.com/blog/delegate-tasks-effectively/) and more committed to your business. Small business owners face an enormous job, as they are almost always both the boss and an essential worker in the business. But whatever the size of your business, you shouldn't try to do everything yourself. Relying on the right tools and the right people can free you up for making larger and more impactful decisions for your business. **Want to get your business above six figures?**[**Get a step-by-step guide here**](https://ebook.katebagoy.com/lto)**!**
