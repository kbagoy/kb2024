Your business deserves only the very best. You should also be aware of the common pitfalls for new startups. One of the best things to know is the underutilized tools that many small business owners don't even realize are available. If you educate yourself, you might get a leg up in a market that can be quite difficult.

## **Outsourcing Agencies**

Outsourcing is the practice of moving certain parts of your business to [**other contractors or companies**](https://www.outsourceaccelerator.com/articles/how-to-choose-outsourcing-companies/) who will complete the tasks for you. This can prove very useful for elements of running a business that you don’t feel are very relevant to what your company does. 

It also is helpful to have seasoned professionals deal with something that you and your employees likely don’t have experience with. A few common examples are the outsourcing of accounting, taxes, and human resources. Research outsourcing agencies that you can utilize for the best results that will benefit the weaknesses of your specific business.

## **Networking Sites**

The modern internet has radically changed how the career industry functions. Many people still will ask for paper resumes, for example–but many others will include a digital aspect in their hiring process. Networking sites like LinkedIn and Handshake are becoming more and more common. About 23% of employers say social media led them to hire a candidate. 

Social media is even used by employers to [**double-check the nature of their candidates**](https://olytac.com/social-media-and-personal-privacy-part-1/). If you want to stay on top of the shifting trends in the current job market, it’s a good idea to get a strong social media presence. 

## **Proper Technology Integration**

The internet isn’t the only thing that has evolved. Along with social media usage for companies (which can include everything from hiring to branding), more [**technology is being incorporated**](https://newtohr.com/how-to-smoothly-integrate-new-processes-and-technology-into-your-business/) into the customer experience. Sometimes it might be for practical reasons, and other times it might simply be for aesthetic purposes, but it always enhances your business when used appropriately. For example, people expect restaurants and other food service locations to be accessible through delivery applications like UberEats or DoorDash. Make sure to understand what the technical standards currently are for your industry. Keep that in mind when creating your business budget.

Running a business is hard no matter what–even if you had all the funding you could possibly need. It’s up to you to use the opportunities you have to build the best company possible. Always be researching and updating your understanding of the industry’s trends.
