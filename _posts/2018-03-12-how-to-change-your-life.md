Ready to change your life!? Great. Stop talking about how much you "wish" for something, and MAKE A DECISION to get it. More importantly, once you've made the decision - you've decided what you want, you've decided you're not willing to settle anymore, you must take IMMEDIATE action. _**You see, we only have a limited time to make a big change.**_ A moment of clarity, if you will. Act on it: Do it, schedule it or tell someone. Whatever you do, don't wait for the "right time."

> The Right Time is the greatest destroyer of dreams - it simply doesn't exist.
