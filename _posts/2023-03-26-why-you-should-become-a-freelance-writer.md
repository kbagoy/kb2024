Writing is a skill that doesn’t come easy to everyone, but if it’s something you do well and enjoy then you should consider potential writing careers.  Working as a freelance writer is a great way to earn some extra money and improve your craft. It’s a very flexible option with plenty of opportunities.

## **Increase Your Income Ceiling**

Your income ceiling is a metaphorical barrier you hit when you are no longer able to earn more money based on the work you’re doing. For example, if you’re a photographer you can only handle so many clients at a time. In order to make more money, you either need to raise your prices or hire more help so you can take on more clients.  With freelancing, you get to increase how much you’re able to earn. You have more control over the work you’re able to do and you can take on as many clients as you can. If you have another job, then [working as a freelancer](https://www.crowdcontent.com/blog/writers-hub/9-benefits-of-freelance-writing-as-told-by-top-content-writers/) only adds to the income you’re making.

## **Start Your Own Retirement Plan**

Everyone should begin saving for retirement as early as they can. This gives you more time to save up for retirement. As a freelancer, you have a lot of options when it comes to starting a retirement account. You get to choose the plan that works best for you.  [SEP-IRAs are ideal](https://www.planperfectretirement.com/sep-vs-401k/) choices for self-employed people due to their simplicity. They have high contribution limits, don’t require contributions each year, and are extremely flexible. Other plan options include traditional and Roth IRA plans, Solo 401(k) accounts, and a simple IRA.

## **More Flexibility**

One of the main benefits of being a freelance writer is you have more control over your career and what work you do. You get to choose what projects you work on. You choose where you work from. You’re in control of how much you work at a time. You aren’t beholden to anyone else’s schedule (aside from the needs of your clients). [As a freelancer](https://www.crowdcontent.com/blog/writers-hub/9-benefits-of-freelance-writing-as-told-by-top-content-writers/), it’s easier to have a work-life balance and you don’t need to feel overwhelmed by work. Everything is on your terms.  If writing is something you want to pursue, then you should look into freelance work. You can improve your writing skills, explore new kinds of writing, and earn some extra money. It’s worth it to learn more about being a freelance writer.  **Did you enjoy reading this article?
