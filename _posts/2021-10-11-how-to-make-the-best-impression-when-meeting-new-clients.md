It has often been said that you have one chance at a great first impression. When meeting with a prospective client, you are pitching your character and your company as an option for doing business with, in the future. Your first impression is critical to attracting new clients. Make the best impression when meeting new clients by practicing for the meeting, finding a meeting space, and working on your personal presentation. 

## **Practice for Your Meeting** 

When preparing to meet clients, you must practice for your meeting. Practice your presentation skills in front of a mirror to help identify spots you can improve. Don’t just practice your sales pitch, [practice names, facts, and details](https://customerthink.com/14-tips-for-making-a-great-impression-on-new-clients/) about the company. Your clients will trust you to handle their needs if you can demonstrate an understanding of their business. Practicing also entails making an agenda for your meeting to stay on track and cover all your desired material. 

## **Find a Meeting Space** 

Your meeting space will depend on the nature of the meeting and level of formality you wish to have with your prospective client. If you run your business from home and don’t have a great meeting spot, consider meeting at a café or virtual office space. Virtual offices [can be a great cost-saving measure](https://psoffices.com/planspricing/#virtualspace) if you only need an office on occasion. Whichever space you choose, make sure the environment is not distracting and it aligns with the values of your client. 

## **Personal Presentation** 

Your appearance greatly impacts a potential client’s perception of you. When you dress professionally, you show respect for your business, your products, your services, and of course your clients. [Dress to impress](https://www.business.qld.gov.au/running-business/marketing-sales/sales/skills/first-impressions) your clients, but to match the occasion that you are meeting them under. Make sure your personal hygiene is thought of; your hair and nails well-groomed and breath not offensive. Your posture will also impact the presentation. Stand up straight, confident, and relaxed. Ultimately, you want to come off as the best version of yourself: professional but relatable, confident, and competent. 

Part of making a good impression for your clients is presenting yourself in a pleasing light. You must also find a good place where you can meet and discuss business details. Most importantly, you must demonstrate to your client that you know their business and they can trust you. Practice for your meeting to prepare you for any scenario or situation that may come up.
