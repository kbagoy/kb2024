### Here's the REAL reason you're stuck in a job you hate (& what to do about it...)

**How long have you been thinking about starting your own business?**

I'm guessing, if you're anything like me, you've toyed with the idea for years.

**Years!?!**

So often I meet people who think they're not capable of starting a business - their skills aren't good enough, their portfolio isn't good enough, they're not creative enough, not educated enough... but those are just stories they tell themselves.

_**After talking to 100's of people, I can tell you that your skills or experience have little to do with your success when it comes to entrepreneurship.**_

**Do you want to know the real reason you're still stuck?**

It's FEAR.

- Fear disguised as **perfectionism.**
- Fear disguised as **self-doubt**.
- Fear disguised as **depression** or **anxiety**.
- Fear disguised as **laziness**.

_Fear is real b\*tch._

> **Did you know that your body has the same fear response to self-promotions as it does to a bus coming at you?!**

_REALLY! Your brain doesn't understand the difference between real danger (the bus) and perceived danger (the threat of rejection)._

_**That means you have the same PANIC response when you're thinking of launching your business that you would if you were playing in traffic.**_

So, naturally, you find ways to avoid taking the action that will get you out of your job.

- **You suddenly find yourself very, very busy** and unable to prioritize yourself or your sidehustle
- **You mysteriously fall sick** just when you're about to hit send on that email blast or publish your site
- **You magically find a reason why your job is going to get better** in 6 months and you should TOTALLY just stick it out (again)
- **You realize the kitchen sink hasn't been cleaned in ages** and must be scrubbed RIGHT now, or you will die.

**Procrastination is a form of fear too.**

You're not lazy, and you don't lack self-control.

You're scared!

**So, how can you outsmart your brain and get unstuck?**

1. **Tell yourself the whole story**. If you can't get yourself to publish your website, find out what you're afraid of. Then ask yourself what would REALLY happen if you launched with a typo. **Would you actually die? Or would you just fix the typo?** Take the fear out of the story you're telling yourself.

2. **Create a sense of confidence.** See yourself actually succeeding instead of telling yourself you can't, by creating a plan you're confident in and by making small steps everyday. Feel confident in your ability to run your own business, and **feel proud for taking action**.

_**Your mindset is the #1 factor in your business success.**_
