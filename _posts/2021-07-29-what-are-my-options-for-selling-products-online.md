If you are a small business owner, entrepreneur, or freelancer, you’re probably wondering how to sell products online successfully. It can be tricky to know how to make a significant profit while maneuvering the challenges of online marketing. Here are a few different options for selling your products online and how to make a sizable profit.

## **Use a Marketplace**

One great way you can advertise and sell your products is by using a marketplace like Etsy or Facebook, Instagram Shopping, or Facebook Marketplace. [These marketplace sites](https://www.sellbrite.com/blog/best-ecommerce-marketplaces/) can be advantageous because your company can gain lots of followers and create content that is visually appealing for your followers. Especially if you are interested in crafting or creative products, you may want to try Etsy, which is a gathering place for creators, crafters, and lovers of DIY projects. The search features on these sites allow your potential customers to browse different products that they’re interested in without needing to know the name or website of your company previously.

## **Create a Website**

One of the most important things that you can do to be successful in online sales and marketing is creating a website. You can do so by hiring a website coder or using a website template that you can find online (we use [Divi for Wordpress](http://www.elegantthemes.com/affiliates/idevaffiliate.php?id=28328)).  When creating your website, you want to make sure that it will be easy to find when people are searching on the internet. Try to use simple and straightforward URLs that are easy to remember and transparent in their nature. In your website descriptions and content, use keywords that are related to your services and products.  This will help your company to come up as one of the first options when potential customers search for products. If you choose to create an eCommerce website, make sure you have it [properly set up to take orders](https://www.ecwid.com/wordpress). Make sure that you have safe and secure transaction technology since this will encourage customers to buy products from your website.

## **Social Media**

Since websites aren’t exactly social media platforms, you’ll want to run social media pages for your business to gain greater visibility. One of the best ways to improve your online sales is to [post regularly on social media](https://www.digitalmarketing.org/blog/how-to-use-social-media-for-businesshttps:/www.digitalmarketing.org/blog/how-to-use-social-media-for-business) such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram and try to increase your following.  The more people that are following your accounts and seeing the products you are posting, the more sales your business will have. To increase your following, try posting behind-the-scenes videos or reels with lifestyle or care tips that relate to the products that you sell. These kinds of posts can be very interesting for your followers and can reach other individuals that don’t already follow your account. The more people that follow and view your social media pages, the more people will buy your products.

## **Have an Attractive Aesthetic**

Before your website is live online, you’ll want to make sure that it is [attractive to your viewers](https://axiomq.com/blog/make-ecommerce-website-more-attractive/) and customers. The overall color scheme and aesthetic should be stylish, following the current trends in online marketing sites. Your site should be easy to maneuver, with a clear menu and direct instructions.  Include simple descriptions of each of your products so customers know important details about the products they want to purchase. You’ll also want to make sure that you include updated and attractive product photos since photos are enticing for customers. These details will help your site to be easy to maneuver so that your customers won’t get frustrated using it and will be persuaded to buy your products.

## **Clear Communication Lines**

In order to have an eCommerce site, you need to maintain [clear and facilitated communication](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/02/clear-and-effective-communication-in-web-design/) with your customers through different features. You’ll want to make sure that your contact information can be easily found on your social media or website so that your customers can easily contact you if they have questions about a product or need help.  You can even consider setting up a live customer service chat or using your direct messages to facilitate communication lines. If you can resolve customer concerns quickly, they’ll be more likely to be loyal to your company and continue buying your products, which is why clear communication lines are so important.

## **Get Rid of Issues**

There are a lot of issues or annoyances that can turn off online shoppers from buying products. If your social media page has excessive ads or your website has lots of popups that are distracting and annoying, your potential customers probably won’t ever make it to buying something from your company.  Another issue for many customers is additional surprise costs like shipping. Many customers are willing to pay the price for certain products but don’t want to follow through with their purchase when they see that taxes and shipping will be tacked onto the price at the end. If possible, try to run sales or offer free shipping on your products so customers are encouraged to buy your products. As you are preparing to sell your products online, review these different selling options and figure out what will work best for the products that you are trying to sell. Remember that making the customer’s experience enjoyable is one of the best ways to increase your sales. As you market your website, products, and services to the interests of your audience, your online sales will become very successful. **To know more about my best business tips,**[**check out my book**](https://www.sixfigurefreelancers.com/ebook)**!**
