https://youtu.be/sAZzfsWCV7g   Are you a small business owner looking to make it big? Have you ever wondered if being a consultant would take you on your dream path to success? Many other small business owners or entrepreneurs like yourself have enjoyed the benefits of a consultant job. Being a consultant is a great job, so here are a few reasons why you should consider it.

## **Flexible Schedule**

One of the best parts of being a consultant is that you are able to choose your own work schedule. This means that you get to decide how many hours you work a day and how many days you work during the week. Of course, you’ll still want to make sure that you are available when your clients are able to meet with you. Many consultants don’t even work 40 hours a week, or what would be considered full-time, since they are able to make enough income without holding on to a 9-5 job. While working less hours and [having a flexible schedule](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2019/flex-work-programs-that-actually-work) can seem attractive for many reasons, it can also promote better mental health and a more balanced lifestyle.

## **Serving Others**
