I'm a Miami-Dade County type of girl.

This may shock some of you, almost as much as the fact that I listen to Justin Bieber & Luke Bryant with gleeful abandon & joy (without shame)

_It's a bit of a surprise myself, but I digress.._

Over the last few months I've been considering moving to South Florida and, inevitably, no matter who I spoke with I got the same party line.

"I don't think you'll like Miami. You should checkout Fort Lauderdale. Or Boca."

So, after driving across country, I did.

I like Fort Lauderdale, but I have to wonder - what is it about me that inspires people to think "_this girl needs to live in a white enclave next to a Costco?_"

Is it the tattoos?

The fact that I spent the last two years traveling through 20+ countries?

That my Spanish sucks?

I don't know...

Fort Lauderdale is lovely, but today I visited Miami & Miami Beach.

AND that is my vibe.

**I'm in LOVE with Miami.**

Everyone was telling me that FLD was more "low-key," but that's not what it felt like to me.

I mean, you could die in traffic trying to get the damn Publix in Ft. Lauderdale.

I could walk to the Whole Foods in South Beach from an apartment.

**Maybe I have a different definition of low-key.**

When I say low key I mean chill. Easy. Good vibes only. Low drama.

Give me gritty, give me artsy, give me culture, give me cafes... give me some DIVERSITY.

I love that shit.

Like I love Law & Order reruns\*.

Anyway, here I am STILL learning new things about myself. Everyday.

Like, I love Miami.

_And I STILL lend waaaay too much credence to other peoples opinions._

Isn't it amazing when you realize your hunches were right the first time?

That you've always known what was best for you.

**Yet, how easily do we ignore or discard our intuition because we're influenced by others?**

One of the things I do as life & business coach is help clients tap into their internal GPS and acknowledge what is actually right for them.

Not what's right for mom or cousin Mary or Penny down the lane.

We ALL know what we want, deep down.

We FEEL it in our bones, or our guts or heart.

But we bury those feelings and tell ourselves stories.

**Listen to your elders / friends / family / THAT guy because "They" know better.**

_They MUST know better because they are older / wiser / smarter / more experiences / more successful / insert adjective here._

But it's all just BS we tell ourselves.

THEY don't know what is best for YOU.

They likely mean well - but _**just because something is true for someone else doesn't mean it will be true for you.**_

My friends LOVE Fort Lauderdale and Boca Raton, and they are lovely places - I can see why.

But... maybe because I'm weird, or maybe some of my friends just really, REALLY love Costco in a way I don't, I'd rather be in The City.

And that's okay.

_But I sure am glad I didn't sign a lease up North._

Because, just as I suspected months ago when I started thinking about moving, Miami is the bomb.

I mean sure - hurricanes, gators, face-eating, bath-salt smoking junkies and out of control iguanas are all possibilities here.

But it's totally my jam.

Viva Miami!

Now I've just got to find an apartment & furnish it & start my life over as a "former" digital nomad.

Fácil.

See you soon, Miami.

XOXO,

Kate

\*True fact: I've seen every episode of the original & SVU, many twice and was easily able to navigate NYC when I visited solely because of my L&O experience.
