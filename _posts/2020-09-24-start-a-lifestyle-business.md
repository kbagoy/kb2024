# Start a Lifestyle Business, They Said, It'll be Easy,They Said...

Hey, I'm Kate Bagoy, a former corporate slave turned freedom seeker, spiritual junkie, life hacker, and travel addict.

I started my coaching practice as a "lifestyle business" and I've built my entire brand while traveling to 25-ish countries, often working from the beach, and based solely on my Instagram feed, my life probably looks perfect.

News flash: it's not.

No one has a perfect life, no matter how it looks online.

- You don't know who's had heartbreak or pain or depression or struggle.
- You don't know who's got 100K followers but can barely afford their rent.
- You don't know who hasn't cleaned their house for 6 weeks because they suddenly have kids at home full-time and work full-time from their closet and side-hustle half-time and are all-kind-of-stressed out about the nightmare that is US politics right now.

**Remember this for ALL the friends and "influencers" you follow online... You're seeing a highlight reel, so STOP COMPARING YOURSELF.**

Shaming yourself for not being perfect is a guaranteed way to stay stuck where you are.

_I'm 42 years old, been single for 3 years, have a negative net worth thanks to $120,000 worth of student loans and still don't know what I want to do with my life._

I'm also happier than I've ever been because I stopped trying to live someone else's idea of a perfect life.

Once upon a time, I worked for a Fortune 500 sportswear company, made great money, had killer benefits, a fat 401K and was living the "American dream."

I hated my life - but I was great at pretending everything was okay, even when I was drinking myself to sleep every night.

In 2008 I finally wised up and decided to stop pretending everything was okay.

I quit my job without a plan and tried freelancing.

I say tried, 'cause I FAILED.

I hustled 60 hours a week working with broke-ass "make the logo bigger" clients, and could barely pay my mortgage.

It was so exhausting I decided to get my master's degree just so I could live off student loans. :)

That got me into startups, UX design, marketing, growth hacking - and a breakdown lead to me getting sober & doing mindset work.

When I decided to go freelance again in 2014, it was a different game.

It turns out that freelancing, when approached as a BUSINESS (not a job hunt), can be quite lucrative and easy.

But most creative people - or anyone who's spent their career as an employee - don't know how to business. I mean, it's overwhelming AF, right?

First, you've got the fear and self-doubt that shows up in the form of procrastination, imposter syndrome, paralysis by analysis, and over-complication.

**Then there are eleventy-million people online who will guarantee you success if you just follow their top-secret method and "HUSTLE MORE."** 

What they fail to tell you is this...

**Hustling on the wrong sh\*t is a guaranteed way to burn yourself out and go broke.**

All the social posts in the world, no matter how great, will do jack shit for your business if you don't have the right foundation.

The "perfect" Facebook ad will bankrupt you if you don't have the right funnel in place.

**And your self-sabotaging "I'm not good enough" mind trash will block you at every stage of your business if you don't start to address it.**

This is true wether you want to start a lifestyle business or you want to open up a salon.

### Your mindset is the #1 factor in your success, followed closely by your ability to work on the right things at the right time.
