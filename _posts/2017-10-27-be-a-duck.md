Ya'll, I'm tired.

I was chatting with a friend of mine this morning about my webinar (which didn’t go as anticipated), and she reminded me of something profound:

> “With people who are successful we only hear of their successes, not all the behind the scenes day to day trials and errors.”

Well, I don't want to mislead you into thinking that building a business is always easy.

I’ve been successful and I’ve been a failure and right now I’m somewhere in-between. I fail on a weekly basis at something in my life and new business but I’m still an “overnight success” in the making.

- One of my coaches, Tony Robbins, likes to say that you'll be rewarded publicly for what you do privately.
- If you get up everyday at 6am to train for a marathon, no one will know. But you'll finish the race.
- If you give up 30 minutes of television everyday, no one will know, but they'll enjoy reading your book when it comes out.
- If you sacrifice vacation days to grow your "sidehustle" to a point you can leave your day job, no one will know, but they'll hire you anyway.
- If you nearly go bankrupt launching your first business, but finally get it right on your last try, you'll still be called an overnight success.

And that's kind of where I'm at with this business. I became a coach because I believe life is too short to simply exist - and I want to help people design amazing lives. And I absolutely love what I do. But I made mistakes in my new business early on and I’m nearly out of cash, which scares the living hell out of me.

Right now, I'm like a duck - calm on the surface but paddling like mad to keep afloat and wondering if I've made a mistake.

This is part of the up and down, chaotic, totally exciting entrepreneur life. One day, you're on top of the world. The next day you're not sure if you're on the right path at all.

But, what I've found is that if I keep going, in-spite of the fear and self-doubt and shame, I'm far more likely to succeed than I am if I give up.

So keep going. Keep paddling. I believe in you.

Let me know how I can help.
