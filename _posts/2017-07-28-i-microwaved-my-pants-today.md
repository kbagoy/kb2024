**As a digital nomad, people are always asking what I miss from home.** The food? Rarely. The culture? Nope. Medical care? Just my acupuncturist. My friends? Of course. No one ever guesses what I miss most… my laundry room.

**I realize this makes me sound like a clean freak, but I assure you I am not.** After 7-months of poor laundry service, washing machines that left clothes stiff or smelling of sewage, and washing skivvies in the sink I’ve reached a new low by microwaving my pants in an effort to dry them faster.

You see, I don’t have a backup pair of workout pants. I have an essential wardrobe as I carry my entire life in a backpack as I move from city to city. So if my basement apartment doesn’t have the airflow to dry my pants in 18-hours I either go to the gym in jeans or I don’t go.

_So, I microwaved my pants today._

**It’s interesting the things we acclimate to.** I never would have guessed [Remote Year](http://www.remoteyear.com/general-application?referee=5132575) would lead to such innovative laundry techniques (I’ve also ironed with a hair dryer before, my friend uses her hair straightener), much less a non-plussed attitude towards not having creature comforts.

I’ve gone from living in a 1,200ft2 condo alone, filled with awesome “things” I love, to not knowing where I’ll live next month and carrying less than 20kgs (30lbs) of baggage, which includes everything I need to run a business.

**_It’s liberating as hell._**

It’s hard to describe the experience of life on the road and what this year has  _really_ been about, but if I had to break it down it would be this:

**_This lifestyle is about letting go._**

“Let go of preconceived notions, fear, the need for certainty, the social constructs we live with, the stories we tell ourselves, expectations and, of course, material goods.”

In February, I had the honor of participating in a lantern ceremony where we wrote our hopes for Remote Year on a lantern before releasing it to the sky. One of my mates hoped for all ‘Remotes’ to find themselves & at the time I remember thinking, “I already know who I am.”

**But I could not have been more wrong. I only knew myself in certain terms.**

I knew who I was in the context of my old life — of being a great designer & a trusted advisor for the startups I worked with — not as a coach and new online marketer. I knew who I was in my social group and as a solo traveler, not as a community member of 60 new faces. I knew who I was with my makeup and hair the way I like it, wearing the clothes I want, not in the 1,000 degree heat of Asia where makeup becomes pointless and I have a 20-piece wardrobe.

**I’ve learned I’m stronger than I think I am.** That I’m an eternal optimist capable of looking for the lesson or the good in anything. I’ve learned I’m a survivor and a hustler and I’m not willing to settle for mediocrity. I’ve learned that it doesn’t matter what I have, or don’t have, in my life when it comes to being happy and being loved. Those things come from within.

**And I’ve learned it all by letting go of one thing at a time.**
