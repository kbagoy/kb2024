## Coronavirus Business Tips: Don't Panic, Plan

And YES, it's totally appropriate to #ALWAYSBESELLING.

**Imagine if Charmin decided tomorrow to stop selling...**

Would you applaud them for "being sensitive" or would you be appalled you have to wipe your bum on coffee filters?

**Now is NOT the time to stop selling.**

Now is NOT the time to panic.

Maybe it's time to pivot.

Maybe it's time to serve.

**Maybe it's time to take a break and strategize a new path forward - but if you are in business, \*it is your JOB to sell\*.**

Especially if you have employees you are supporting!

Should a business stop selling and fire all their employees?

F\*ck no.

That's far more irresponsible than stepping up and growing the business (or at least keeping doors open).

**There is nothing dirty, sleazy or wrong about selling.**

And if you're selling something that people need, it's actually a service!

_It's a service of all Charmin employees to be getting up and going to work to make the TP._

_It's a service for the truck drivers who are on the roads in spite of their own fear or health to get it to stores._

_It's a service for supermarket employees to stay open and sell._

And it's a service opportunity for you to show up and help your clients.

We are living in scary times and it's easy to focus on the fear.

It's easy to think of all the ways our business might be hurt.

It's easy to imagine we have to close our doors.

**Resilient entrepreneurs find a way forward.**

There is opportunity out there if you look for it.

**The market will eventually rebound. Restaurants will eventually reopen. Business will boom again.**

Now is the time to plan.

**Now is the time to show up and focus on the opportunities.**

Now is the time to focus on HELPING.

Help your clients. Help yourself.

**Stop panicking and start serving.**

If you'd like some help flipping your mindset and strategizing a path forward, I'm here for you.
