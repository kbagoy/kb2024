One of the most difficult parts of running a business is balancing your budget and making sure you have the funds you need to get things done. There are some monthly expenses that are absolutely essential and need to be a part of your monthly budget. On the other hand, there are also expenses that many businesses pay for each month that aren’t really necessary to making sure that your business is as successful as it should be.

## **Software**

It’s likely that there are some software expenses that you will need to pay each month or purchase upfront. But there are other software needs that can be met with free options that are still amazing resources for your company. If you are feeling like you might be spending too much on your software, it may be time to look around and see if there are free software options available that can actually help you to do [even better with your daily tasks](https://www.cio.com/article/2380921/open-source-tools-how-to-run-your-small-business-with-free-open-source-software.html). If you can find free versions that get the job done, it can save your business a lot of money.

## **A Phone Line**

Some businesses are still using a landline or mobile phone to take care of calls. This option is expensive, and it is usually totally avoidable since you can make calls over the network using your internet connection. VoIP makes it easy to make and take calls [using just the internet](https://www.voipphonesupply.com/voip-examples/). So if your business still is paying for a landline and internet, it might be time to make the switch and close your landline. You can often even use the same phone number for your VoIP calls, so the transition can be incredibly smooth.

## **Missing Deductions**

It’s important that your business is thorough in filing taxes and that you take advantage of all the deductions you are qualified for. If you aren’t doing this, you may find that you are spending more on taxes than you should, and that can land you in financial trouble if you don’t rectify the issues. It may seem like an added expense to hire an accountant, but they can help you to file your taxes more effectively so you [don’t spend unnecessarily](https://www.freshbooks.com/blog/mistakes-business-expenses).

Taking care of your business is important and balancing your budget is a huge part of that. Take time to look through your budget and figure out what extra expenses you may not need to spend on. That will help you to decrease your costs and keep things running as well as possible.
