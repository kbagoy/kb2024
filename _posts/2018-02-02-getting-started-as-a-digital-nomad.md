I see dozens of post each week asking how to get started as a digital nomad.

The short answer?

- Find a job or start a business you do online.
- Sell your junk.
- Pack a bag and book a flight.

It's seriously that simple... but of course _**simple does not mean easy**_.

If you're ready to get started as digital nomad, your first order of business is to decide how you're going to make a living.

But, more importantly, you wanna ask yourself why you even want to...

After 13 months of full-time travel, Iâ€™m sitting down to answer some of your top questions about this life and my adventures with [Remote Year](http://www.remoteyear.com/general-application?referee=5132575) and as a solo digital nomad.

Today I talk about how I got started and share some key tips for changing your life, kicking off the location independent lifestyle and traveling as a nomad.

I also discuss my take on being a digital nomad over on [Medium.](https://medium.com/@kbagoy/want-to-travel-more-heres-how-i-got-started-as-a-digital-nomad-2dd52f765dc1)
