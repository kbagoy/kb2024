## **Use Organic Strategies**

Organic marketing strategies are marketing strategies that have little or no cost to you and can help to grow your presence naturally. Organic marketing strategies [are a very cost effective way](https://www.glofox.com/blog/organic-digital-marketing-strategy/) to market yourself because it is practically free, you only pay for management and tracking your marketing. A great way to do this is to develop a strong social media presence, encouraging clients to engage on social media to spread the word about your business. Another option you have is to start a blog. Writing your own blog posts can help put more information out there that is associated with your business, increasing the likelihood that someone lands on your business page searching the internet. You should also use SEO, or search engine optimization strategies, to make sure that your website is designed to show up on search engines more frequently. 

## **Keep it Online**

If you are advertising in any medium other than online, then you are spending more money than is necessary to reach your audience. We are an increasingly digital world and society, and your marketing strategy should reflect that. [Online advertising costs 62% less](https://www.dotcomdesign.com/online-marketing-davenport/) than traditional advertising. And with the global reach and target audience tools that online advertising offers helps ensure that you are advertising to people that have an interest in the products and services that your business offers. Billboards may be great, but then you are tied to a specific location, and have no way to narrow your audience. On the internet, you have the ability to target your specific audience, all over the globe. 

## **Know Who Your Target Audience Is**

If you don’t have a very specific audience for your business, then you are wasting tons of money on advertising to groups and demographics that don’t have interest in your business. If you feel like you already have a specific audience, try to get more specific. [Specificity in your target demographic](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/segment-target-market-61135.html) can be scary for many business owners, as they fear it will limit their potential growth, but the truth is the opposite.

This will help you grow your business much more than you could imagine. 

Marketing is not easy, it is more of an art than a science. And just like all good art, good marketing is expensive.
