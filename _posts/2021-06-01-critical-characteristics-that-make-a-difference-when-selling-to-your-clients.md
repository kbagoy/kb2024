As a business owner or freelancer, you are also unknowingly becoming a salesperson. The salesperson client relationship is always tricky. How do you know what your future and current clients need? Here’s a secret; your clients care less about the product and more about the relationship they have with you. That is what keeps them coming back. Be honest, have confidence, and listen to your clients to build a lasting relationship.

## **Honesty**

The most important trait for any relationship is honesty—both with yourself and with others. According to [InvoiceBerry](https://www.invoiceberry.com/blog/honesty-when-speaking-to-customers/), it’s especially important to be honest with your clients. Don’t be afraid to tell them the drawbacks and the advantages of your product when asked. Putting all your cards on the table will give your clients confidence and trust in you. Knowing about the weaknesses helps a client purchase with open eyes and preparedness. These kinds of purchases lead to future purchases as opposed to feeling betrayed and never coming back.

## **Confidence**

To be a good salesperson, you must be confident in the product you are selling. You must know every detail available with the product to answer any questions that come up. Uncertainty puts doubt in the minds of your clients and will drive them away. You are a part of the product. You must be confident in yourself too. According to [Podium](https://www.podium.com/article/why-insurance-agents-fail/), if you want clients to have confidence in you and what you’re selling, you must also be confident in yourself and your products. Believe in your mission and why you do what you do. Stand tall and smile; it will help you go further than you might think.

## **Ability to Listen**

Your clients want to establish a relationship with you while purchasing your product. They want to feel like you are friends, and you are doing a service for them. The only way you can become friends is if you listen to them and make them feel like their voice is heard. People love to talk; they love to talk about themselves even more. According to [Fonolo](https://fonolo.com/blog/2018/04/why-active-listening-is-the-best-customer-service-skill/), when you listen to your client, you give them validation and support. You also allow yourself to listen to and meet your client's needs. Doing this will establish a strong relationship and loyalty between you and your clients.

Not everyone that walks in your doors will connect with you. If you are honest about your products, confident in what you sell, and listen to their needs you will find your dream clients—clients who keep coming back.
