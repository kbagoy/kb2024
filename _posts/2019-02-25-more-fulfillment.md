One common misconception in business is the compartmentalization between personal and professional life.

**_As much as you try to deny it, your life and your business are intertwined… Esssspecially as a business owner!_**

Balance is a verb ya’ll, not a state of being.

I get it, though - you want to set clear barriers so work doesn’t take over your ‘me-time’.

And that’s fair!

_What I am talking about today is_ **_integrating_** _your life’s vision into your business._

See? That sounds more like anyone’s ultimate goal.

So you won’t have LESS personal time by coupling the two... You’ll have more of it!

One way to ensure that your vision is aligned with your personal **values, goals, wants and needs** is to set time to include those into your strategy.

**_Because more alignment in your career = more fulfillment._**

Today is an opportunity to undo a little bit of old training and start to focus on **what's really important to you.**

This is one of the first things I do with my private coaching clients and it’s my favorite part.

So to give you a taste of my exercises, I encourage you to **get out into nature, or find a quiet space** if you’re not able to get out to nature and then ask yourself this question:

If money wasn’t in the equation, would I still be building this idea or chasing this dream?

Answer that question on a piece of paper or a notebook.

Old fashioned, yes - but it triggers your reticular activation center and stimulates your brain.

Actually, according to a [neuroscientific study](https://www.leadershipiq.com/blogs/leadershipiq/the-gender-gap-and-goal-setting-a-research-study) discussed on Forbes, _“__people who very vividly describe or picture their goals are anywhere from 1.2 to 1.4 times more likely to successfully accomplish their goals”._

And this exercise also helps to ensure you’re chasing YOUR dreams, not your parents dreams or doing something you think you **should**.

_Should is a dirty word. Erase it from your vocabulary._

Once you're sure that your on the right path, ask yourself:

What would your perfect day would look like?

That includes both your business and your life, of course.

- Do you wake up at 6:00 am and finish work at 2:00 so you can go pick up your kids?
- Do you sleep in till 10:00 and work until 8:00, then meet your sassy boyfriend for dinner?
- What sort of freedom do you want? Where do you live? Where do you work? How many people do you employ? Or do you not?

You get the ideas - create your perfect day, and with that vision in mind, you can start making minor improvements that are going to get you closer to where you want to be.
