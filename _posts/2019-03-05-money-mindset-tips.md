Alright guys! Let’s talk about money!

Yes, you too, in the back!

We need to talk more specifically about how you feel about money, and whether you are okay **_receiving_** money or not.

So about a year ago, I was taking a course with a coach and he talked about “receiving”, and it made me feel literally ill. Something about that word bothered me.

Turns out, I was not open to receiving. Can you believe it?!

Since that day, I have spent a lot of time removing that blockage to move forward into an abundant life & business.

The exercise I’m sharing with you are some of the key things that helped me - and now my clients - move forward into abundance.

What I've learned is that **your mindset is incredibly important in** **your ability to earn and hold on to money**.

_I’ve have a pattern of earning a lot of money, then overspending and losing everything._

And I could not step out of that cycle until I took the time to look at how I actually feel about money.

**How do YOU feel about MONEY?**

Do you feel your heart opening or closing when you read that word?

_What’s your history with it, and your current situation?_

It is super duper duper important that you are honest with your answers.

**Now, pretend that you are ultra ultra ultra wealthy.**

We are talking Jeff Bezos kind of wealthy.

**What you would do with that money?**

Your answers will bring clarity to what is _really_ important to you and how money-making relates to your personal values.

Taking care of your family or friends, contributing to the world, having more fun or taking better care of yourself will all point in different directions of WHY money is actually important to you - and will influence how you spend (or save) money.

_Another cool thing with this list is that it will guide and motivate you when you start to lose steam in your business._

Last but not least, **why do you deserve to be rich?**

And you do! You absolutely do!

Even if we haven't met in person, I believe that you deserve to be rich and I also believe you’re capable of it.

**_And when you get rich, you are going to make other people rich in a lot of different ways as well._**

**You deserve to be rich** and my hope for you is that you will have figured out WHY, after having read this article and asked yourself these questions.

See, that money-talk wasn’t so rough, was it?
