Learning how to become a smarter decision-maker is a priceless life skill to have. This skill can save you a lot of stress, trouble, and heartache in the future. Getting better and then continuing to make smarter decisions is especially important in business settings where poor decisions can cost you thousands of dollars.

## **Learn From Your Mistakes**

You will never make smarter decisions if you don’t first acknowledge past mistakes and learn from them. Mistakes don’t mean that you will always be bad at making decisions; they just mean that you have room to improve and things to learn.  You should analyze your mistakes objectively without getting too emotional or hurt over them, which may mean waiting a while before fully analyzing a mistake. [“Mistakes journals”](https://koheneducationalservices.com/prep-effectively-with-a-mistakes-journal/) are commonly used for standardized test preparation, but they can also be used for any type of mistake as well. When documenting your mistakes, you can record what happened, what could have gone differently, and what you learned.

## **Gather Data**

Making good decisions depends heavily on having good data. Data gives you direction for making decisions because it allows you to predict possible outcomes. Good business decisions [rely on key insights.](https://blog.finchbrands.com/what-makes-a-great-key-insight-finch-brands) These insights typically include revenue analysis, sales trends, and consumer patterns. If you are not good at gathering data yourself, hire someone to help you or use data-gathering programs.

## **Avoid Making Reckless Decisions**

Wise decisions are based on sound judgment. Typically, these decisions are thought up, analyzed, and implemented gradually. This gradual progression of decision-making leads to better thought-out choices with more positive outcomes. Being in the right mindset is crucial to avoiding reckless decisions. For example, you should not make important decisions when you are exhausted since[exhaustion makes it hard to concentrate](https://debrasmouse.com/why-decision-making-is-hard-exhausted-science/). Similarly, you should avoid making important decisions when you are particularly hungry or emotional either. These outside factors affect you physically and mentally, leading to more reckless decisions. More reckless decisions could have serious negative repercussions on your life and business.  In the business world, you need to consistently be making intelligent decisions to succeed in your market and stay relevant. Learning decision-making skills in other parts of your life can greatly improve the quality of your decision-making in terms of your business. Becoming a smarter decision-maker will only happen as you continually make decisions. Learn to take considerable risks and choose what you think is best. Then, always be willing to learn from your mistakes.  **Want to start your own business?**[**Learn more about my secret strategies**](https://ebook.katebagoy.com/lto).
