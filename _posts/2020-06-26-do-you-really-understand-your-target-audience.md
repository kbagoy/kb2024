When your business is in growth mode, it’s important to evaluate different aspects of your business, such as your target audience and determine how those factors can help you achieve your goals. You need to pinpoint the small facets that help complete the big picture. A good place to start is with your target audience. Knowing who your target audience is and understanding their needs can help your business thrive.

## **Tracking Interactions**

Tracking customers within the bounds of appropriate, ethical business is essential for the growth of your company. It is basically the only way you can truly analyze what is working and what isn’t working about your marketing strategies. Luckily, there are so many different ways you can track customer interactions.

First, try website analytics. According to [Optimizely](https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/web-analytics/), this tool allows you to measure the traffic of your website and where this traffic is coming from. It also supplies your data analysts with information about the marketing tactics that are clicked on most often, and which ones more commonly lead to sales. Second, you will want to implement ad network conversion tracking to let you see who is finding your brand through ads on the internet. This data will get you one step closer to figuring out who your target audience is and what market strategies are successful.

## **Marketing Segmentation**

Marketing segmentation is a key technique to better optimizing your marketing strategy. Basically, it is a method of research that allows for you to target certain audiences by dividing customers into sub-categories according to certain demographics or characteristics. According to [Podium](https://www.podium.com/article/marketing-segmentation/), the most common ways audiences are segmented are by their life cycle stage, the amount they spend, by their geographic location, and by the level of their engagement. It is highly recommended that you use this technique when identifying how to best target certain audiences.

## **Conduct Surveys**

After using marketing segmentation and interaction tracking to identify your audience, you will want to get to know this audience as well as you can. One of the best ways to do this is to conduct surveys.

While not everybody is willing to fill out a survey, any small amount of information you can get from your customers is helpful. According to [UX Booth](https://www.uxbooth.com/articles/the-essential-guide-to-writing-effective-survey-questions/), make sure your surveys are short and easy to understand. Be willing to gain honest criticism—as it will help you grow as a company. Ask customers about your products or services and whether they got the help they needed.

One of the greatest mistakes business owners make is marketing before actually knowing their target audience. If you don’t know your audience, then you won’t know how to best market to them. By tracking information, using marketing segmentation, and conducting surveys you will have most of the information you need to be successful and [help your business grow](https://katebagoy.com/work-with-me).
