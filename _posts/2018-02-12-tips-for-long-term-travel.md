In this week's video I answer the most common question I get about life on the road & life with [Remote Year](http://www.remoteyear.com/general-application?referee=5132575): "H _ow do you pack for a year of travel!?_ " or "How to get everything in your bag?" The short answer? I don't! My top tips for long-term travel are to stop stressing! And if you're packing for [Remote Year](http://www.remoteyear.com/general-application?referee=5132575), that's doubly so - just pack light. You can buy local so you can dress for the climate you're in and make it easy to be mobile!  Â
