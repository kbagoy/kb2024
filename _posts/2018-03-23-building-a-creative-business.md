**Sometimes our struggles are the best thing that happen to us.**

It doesn't feel like it at the time, of course.

_At the time it feels on par with having your toenails ripped out one by one, but in the end..._

**In the end, our mistakes help us realize what we will no longer tolerate.**

And then we get to start again, as many times as we need.

**Eighteen months ago I decided to start a coaching business.**

I made a plan, I built a website, I started promoting, and in a short while I got a few clients and I loved it.

**Then I had a new idea. And I kind of started working on that. While kind of doing the other stuff. And traveling full-time and living out of a suitcase...**

_And I stopped doing the things that were working before, without realizing it._

**The clients that had been hiring me stopped showing up with regularity, and I started attracting clients that LOVED what I did, but NO, there was no way they felt they should pay for it...**

## Creativity is a b!tch.

As '_artists_,' we always assume we don't make money because we're not good at our craft, when the reality is that we're simply **selling to the wrong people**, or we're **so unfocused no one knows what the f\*ck we're actually offering**.

**Because when you’re full of ideas, and capable of executing so many of them, it’s hard to pick just one!**

So we try to do them all... but we don’t do any of them well, never finish anything & forget we have to promote to be known. (Pro-tip: one post is not enough!)

Before you know it, you’re a **starving artist working 100 hours a week** just to make rent, feel like you're **running a charity,** or you **wake up in a panic at 1am to look for jobs on LinkedIn** because you clearly can.not.hack.it as a business owner.

Not that I've experienced any of that (this week...) but, at some point we all face a turning point.

> It's time to either pull a Tim Gunn and make it work, or give up and go back to life in a cube.

Personally, I did NOT come this far just to come this far so, it's time to rethink & rebuild.

**Business success comes from persistence, not perfection.**

Ya' gotta get up & back into the arena when you're knocked down, and adjust your tactics until you win.

**That often means finding the intersection of what you do best & what you WANT to do most, and rebooting your business for the client that lives there.**

That doesn't mean you turn away paying clients if you enjoy working with them.

_It means no longer building a business around clients that aren't willing to pay for your expertise._

Stop running your business with your heart or your creative chakra, and find the clients you can help who also want to pay you for what you do.

_Learn from my mistakes & get focused on the best clients for you._

**And if you're a creative person who wants to make a lot of money doing what you love, maybe impacting the world & feeling pretty happy while you do it, let's talk about how I might be able to help you make the same mistakes I have.**

XOXO,
