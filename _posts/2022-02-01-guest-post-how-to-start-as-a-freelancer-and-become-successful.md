![](/assets/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/How-to-Start-as-a-Freelancer-and-Become-Successful.png) **How to Start as a Freelancer and Become Successful** These days, many people are starting to think about how they can ditch the standard office job and find success as a freelancer. The fact is that advancements in technology are making this dream more possible than ever before and there are many jobs that you can do on your own schedule. As an expert on working and finding success online, entrepreneur [Kate Bagoy](https://katebagoy.com/) knows what it takes to accomplish your freelance dreams. To help you out, she has compiled some tips on how to find your dream career. **Types of Freelance Work** Are you interested in starting a freelance career, but you don’t know where to start? The good news is that if there is something that you enjoy doing then there is likely a freelance job that can use your talents. For example, if you have a love for the written language then you could become a [freelance writer](https://thewritelife.com/how-to-become-a-freelance-writer/). If you love being on the go then you could get a job as a driver. If you enjoy music then you could give [music lessons](https://www.learnworlds.com/teach-music-online/) online.  You could even work freelance in several different industries at once. While this new career may count as passive income now, if you find success then you could turn it into your full-time job. **Starting a Business** Once you decide on the type of freelance work you want to do, you need to spend some time creating the best business entity for your needs. Many freelancers set themselves up as a [sole proprietorship](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/sole-proprietorships), there is also the option to create a limited liability corporation.  As an LLC, you can take advantage of many perks including less paperwork, more flexibility, and you may even save money come tax time. While an LLC is easy to set up, you must be aware that [Texas](https://www.zenbusiness.com/texas-llc/) may have certain rules and regulations that you’ll need to follow, so it is a good idea to use a formation service to ensure that you are in full compliance when you start bringing on clients. Check out this great guide from [LLC.org](https://www.llc.org/) to learn how to start an LLC in your state. **Finding Clients** Once you are up and running, you will want to start making money and to do that, you will need to find customers. Doing so can be tough at the start, but you can begin by posting your services on social media or even hanging fliers at busy restaurants or the library.  As part of your marketing efforts, you should at least set up a strong web presence with a [website](https://digital.com/how-to-create-a-website/) that showcases all of your skills. When you have satisfied customers, you can post their positive reviews on your site. You can also ask them to refer their friends, and if you continue to work hard, you could grow your business by leaps and bounds in no time. Make sure to keep your website updated and advertise it wherever possible. **Set Your Pay** Once you are up and running, you will want to set your rates. A good way to start is to look at similar businesses, see what they charge, and then go lower or higher depending on your level of experience. Another way to determine your pay rate is to look at all of your [expenses](https://www.takechargeamerica.org/financial-education/finance-calculator/how-much-am-i-spending-living-household-calculator/) each month. Then, think about how many jobs you can take in that time. Now, think about what you need to charge per job in order to pay your bills and have a bit leftover in profit.  **Be Patient** While your dream may be to turn this passive income stream into a full-time job, it is important not to rush it. Success [will not happen overnight](https://myva360.com/blog/how-long-does-it-take-for-business-to-be-successful#:~:text=Although%20every%20business%20is%20different,the%20most%20famous%20businesses%20today.) and if you rush then you may make costly mistakes that could set you back further. This is why it may be necessary to keep your steady job for now until you get up and running. Remember that you will have bad days, but if you don’t give up then you can eventually find the success that you crave. As you can see, there is a lot that goes into freelancing and earning passive income, but once you have your system down, success will not be far away.
