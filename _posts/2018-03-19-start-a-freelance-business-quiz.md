The world needs more quitters.

Designers, Copywriters, Strategists, Consultants…

All the best quit.

They quit their day job, quit wearing golden handcuffs, quit their commute, and quit living someone else’s dream…

And start their own careers.

Then they go make a boatload of money and never wear a pair of khakis again.

Look, I get it…

Working for somebody else is comfortable.

And giving it up as scary AF.

Especially if you don’t know how to set up a business.

Because even if you’re good at what you do?

(And I’m betting you are.)

You need bidniz skillz to succeed.

But you probably have more skills and assets than you think.

Want to find out?

Take this free readiness assessment and find out if you have what it takes to be successful in your own business.
