Last summer, I had the amazing opportunity to attend [Date with Destiny with Tony Robbins](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8404329/type/dlg/https://www.tonyrobbins.com/events/date-with-destiny/) in Gold Coast, Australia and it was one of the most transformative weeks of my life.

In a week, I made some really good friends and basically required all my core values to better serve me.

I left go of some really old programming around not being good enough and I spent a lot of time getting focused on what I actually want in my life.

**I came away from our week with a vision for my future that included some big tasks:**

1. Growing my location independent business to 7-figures and becoming who I need to do that
2. Prioritizing my health over all other things, excuses be damned and
3. Entering into a loving, passionate healthy relationship with a man I adore.

So far, I’m doing okay on the health\*\* and business and have made about 0 progress on the life partner piece.

When I left [Remote Year](http://www.remoteyear.com/general-application?referee=5132575), one of the reasons I went to London was that I needed some familiarity and had friends there. But another reason was that it seemed the easiest place to start dating and to settle into for a few months, as I was _desperately_ craving stability.

Boy was I wrong.

**_Turns out, when you’ve created a life full of freedom, where you can travel and live where you want and work your own hours, it’s really hard to relate to someone living the typical work-home-tv-sleep-work routine so common in western society._**

Plus, it wasn’t as easy to settle in without a resident visa and I realized I’d really rather not spend winters in the UK…

I mean, that was just kind of a dumb oversight on my part. Why would I go back to cold and rain when I can be anywhere? Duh.

Anyway, from a dating perspective, I thought if I want to meet someone that’s living this crazy life of freedom, and avoid winter, maybe I’d be better off going where the nomads are.

**And I popped on over to Bali.**

Strike 2.

At first I was pretty pleased to be there and I thought I’d settle in for 3–6 months. But life in Bali wore on me pretty quickly for a number of reason, including poor WiFi, lack of sidewalks and general difficulties getting around.

I didn’t spend much time trying to date or even spending much time around other nomads, as the primary workspace in my area was shoulder to shoulder packed everyday.

I made some incredible friends but ultimately didn’t enjoy living in Bali enough to stay, and I just didn’t have the energy to date.

**So, I decided I’d head for the Digital Nomad Epicenter: Chiang Mai, Thailand.**

Everyone is talked to had raved about it, and it’s got the highest concentration of nomads…

In this game I’m playing of **“**[**Are You My City…**](http://amzn.to/2mb4dC6)**”** I though for sure CM would be a great place to grab an apartment and settle in for a few months.

In hindsight, maybe I should have done some research.

**I’ve not been here long, so I’m sure I’m missing some of the magic… but from what I’ve seen, CM is kind of the Tulsa of Thailand.**

It’s a nice place, affordable to live, but not all that exciting. It’s just kind of there.

There ARE a ton of amazing temples, the food is great and there are some good tourist attractions (primarily the elephant sanctuaries), but I’ve learned since I got here the primary reason that CM is so popular is simply the cost of living.

And that is great — you can get a monthly apartment starting around $200 a month for a fleabag or a nice place for $4–700 — but basically CM has gotten its reputation as a nomad place simply because a lot of young nomads are too broke to live anywhere else.

And after 15 months of non-stop travel, a temple is just another temple to me. I don’t mean that to be as douchy as I’m sure it sounds… but once you’ve seen a couple dozen giant gold Buddha’s it’s no longer the draw it was.

**I mean, I drove by three on my way to get coffee this morning. Temples are to Thailand what Walgreens are to America. On every corner.**

So, the search for a new city continues. The search for someone to share my life with continues. The business building continues. The soul searching and health prioritization continues.

**The exhaustion never effing stops.**

But I’ve stopped thinking too much about any of it. I get up every morning and do some meditation and writing, and then I prioritize some work and try to maybe go have some fun, or to relax in the hammock. This week I’ve been dogsitting and I have lots of canine love and I’m pretty busy with the launch of [sixfigurefreelancers.com](http://sixfigurefreelancers.com/)

I’m at a weird cross-roads where I’m too burnout to keep traveling full time but I’m not ready to “go home” either (not that I really know where home is anymore.).

So, for now, I’m slowing down and I’m returning to the western world… but in Australia. I’m heading to Melbourne for 3 months at the end of January and really looking forward to having sidewalks again.

Plus, I hear it’s a lot like Portland with more sun, fewer hipsters and Aussie accents.

Maybe Melbourne will be my new city?

\*\*P.S. I’ve recently met an amazing naturopath that works online with frequent travelers. [Kirsten Swales](http://kirstenswales.com/) specializes in digestion issues (and nearly every travel has them) but she’s seriously an amazing coach and resource. If you’re traveling and a need on-call health support, reach out to her!
