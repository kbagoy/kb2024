**With less than three months until I depart with** [**Remote Year**](http://www.remoteyear.com/general-application?referee=5132575)**, I find myself overwhelmed by daily decisions**, much less life altering decisions such as “who will be renting my apartment,” or “how am I going to survive without Amazon Prime?”

**I’m thrilled and excited and know that this is an opportunity of a lifetime, but I find myself questioning whether I’m ready**. Mainly, I wonder if I’m capable of growing my business while abroad. I second-guess myself and my skills daily, but then I remember that the worst thing that can happen is I fail. I fail miserably and end up broke and have to scrape together funds to come home. But, oh the lessons I will have learned in the meantime! (more)

**So, for now, in between mild panic attacks, I’m spending time getting inspired.** This week I attended the [Giant UX](http://giantconf.com/) conference in Charlotte and was reminded why I love being a freelance UX designer so much, how design impacts our daily lives and that design really can change lives. I remembered how much I love to help companies grow and that I _totally_ geek out about good UX design and startups. I’m looking into joining the UX designers group at [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux), so I might find more companies to help, and I signed up as a mentor at [UX for Change](http://uxforchange.org/). All in all, a pretty good week.

Lastly, I’ve come to realize that **my greatest limitation is my self-doubt, fear and my tendency to compare myself to others.** I’ve known this for awhile, but this week it was hammered home repeatedly that I need to share more. My skills, my experience, my work… and the introvert in me hates that. Yes, I desperately want to share the knowledge I’ve amassed in the hopes of helping others, but I also hate people paying attention to me.

**And I know that I want _need_ to share my remote year experiences as they happen — through writing and photography.** So, this post is a first step in putting my thoughts out there again and starting to practice vulnerability. Next month I’ll be traveling to San Jose, California to attend a [Tony Robbins](https://www.tonyrobbins.com/) event and I’m hopeful that I’ll be even more inspired to shine and to share. If “The Giant” can’t inspire me to stop holding myself back, who can?

**How do you deal with feelings of overwhelm?** How do you stay on course when you feel lost at sea? I’d love to hear your strategies in the comments.

### Update: July 2017

Since this post I’ve been to multiple Tony Robbins events, was rejected from Toptal and changed my entire career when I found my purpose, and traveled with Remote Year for six-months before quitting. I still deal with overwhelm on a regular basis and I’ve been terrible at sharing my experiences so far… but I’m working on it
