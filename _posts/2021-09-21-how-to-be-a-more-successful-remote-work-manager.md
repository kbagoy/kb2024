Working remotely as a manager can be a challenge. You may be unsure how to help your team members or don’t know who is working on what project. However, if you follow the tips below, you can become the successful remote work manager you aspire to be.

## **Stay in Frequent Communication**

[Frequent check-ins on how your team members are doing](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/five-ways-leaders-can-support-remote-work/) can help you manage projects and them stay on task. The check-in doesn’t have to be anything lengthy either. You can simply send them a quick message to see how they’re doing or ask how their projects are coming along. Knowing what issues will arise from projects throughout the process rather than when they are due can be a lifesaver. Many people use applications like Trello to keep up with what their remote team are up to. You could also use email, texts, or Zoom to get a quick update. By staying in touch with your team members, you can help them accomplish their job to its fullest.

## **Conduct Performance Reviews**

To keep your team members motivated and accountable, you can set up monthly or yearly performance reviews. During a performance review, you’d meet one-on-one over the phone or video chat to discuss how your team member is doing. You can manage your expectations of that team member by laying out the specific tasks you’d like them doing each day.  Be sure to set up goals together to keep your team motivated. You could consider offering a raise as an incentive for a team member who is performing exceptionally well. Recognizing team members [can lead to higher engagement](https://www.octanner.com/insights/articles/2019/4/3/your_comprehensive_g.html) in your business. If a team member isn’t matching the expectations you set, you can address this issue during the performance reviews. Many remote entrepreneurs give their team members a warning if they aren’t performing well. Then they give the team member a set deadline to try again and improve at their tasks. If the team member is still not matching expectations, you can let them go.

## **Be Supportive**

When you notice a team member who is lacking motivation, [be there to support them](https://learn.uvm.edu/blog/blog-business/5-leadership-styles-what-styles-do-you-use). Having a supportive, empathetic manager to be there to listen can help remote workers. If they feel like you’re on their side, they will likely work for you longer and be able to handle their current workload.  If your team members are afraid to speak up about uncomfortable topics or issues, send them an anonymous, online survey. Get feedback on how you can improve as a manager. If your team is struggling with something or someone, address the issue carefully and thoughtfully. The main takeaway is to truly listen to your team. Communicate with them often on their projects and listen to any concerns they have. Then address them. If you treat your team members how they want to be treated, then they’ll love working with you. **Ready to start your consulting business?[Grab my book](https://go.katebagoy.com/ebook) to get started today!**
