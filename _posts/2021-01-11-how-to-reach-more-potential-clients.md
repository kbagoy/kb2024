Marketing requires time and/or money. For these precious resources to be spent effectively, you need to make sure that your marketing materials are being put in front of individuals that are in your target market and potential clients. It isn’t super useful to spend time and money on an advertisement for senior medication and then run the ad on a children’s channel. While this is a pretty obvious example, other mistakes may not be so obvious. You can avoid many of the pitfalls and reach your target market by employing the following tips.

## Understand Your Target Demographics

According to [Woblogger](https://www.woblogger.com/what-is-target-marketing-and-why-is-targeting-important-in-marketing/), you should start your advertising endeavors by determining who your target market is. Be specific. For example, if you have a sci-fi action figure, don’t just say kids. A more specific target audience would be kids that enjoy watching the sci-fi show that the action figure comes from. Once you understand who belongs in your target audience, you need to understand more about their habits. In the previous example, you could reasonably deduce that fans of the show will regularly watch certain channels. You can also make guesses as to other media outlets that they will commonly use. The more that you can learn about your potential client's habits, likes, and dislikes, the better you will be able to reach out to them and effectively market your products.

## Expand Your Advertising Strategies

Another way to reach more of your potential clients is to change up the way that you try to contact them. Some of the more conventional methods are TV advertisements, email blasts, website banner ads, social media ads, and text messages. However, you can also use flyers, catalogs, billboards, brand merchandise, car-wraps and audio. Audio ads are growing in popularity due to popular music streaming services and radios. According to [Audiohook](https://www.audiohook.com/what-is-digital-audio-advertising), digital audio advertising spending was projected to reach over $3 billion in 2020.

## Post Regularly

Several small interactions with your potential clients are often more effective than one large interaction. According to [Volusion](https://www.volusion.com/blog/how-often-should-you-post-on-social-media/), that is why it is so important for you to be posting regularly on your business blog and on your social media accounts. This can take a fair amount of effort. You can make things easier if you plan out a month’s schedule for posts. This will help you to have a cohesive message and have engaging content without running out of ideas. Avoid the temptation to always post about ads. This can be annoying to your following.

As you work on your advertising, have a little patience. It takes time to grow a loyal customer base for your business. Keep working at it and you’ll start to see results. Don’t be afraid to change up your strategy if you discover that it isn’t working out as planned. Above all, make sure that you stay connected with your potential clients' needs.
