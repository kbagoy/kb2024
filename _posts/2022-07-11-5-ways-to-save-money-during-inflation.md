## **5 money-saving tips to help battle inflation**

While you may have your own tried and true ways of saving some extra cash, there may be other areas where you can save. Follow along to learn 5 everyday money-saving tips that can help you weather the storm of inflation.

### **1\. Create a Budget**

Creating a budget is a great way to start when looking to achieve any financial goal. Unfortunately, most people often underestimate the amount of money they spend each month. By making a budget, you will discover how much you spend and how much you need for specific monthly expenses. Once you’ve determined what you spend the most [money](https://katebagoy.com/money-mindset-tips/) on, you can easily decide which areas you can afford to cut back on. By cutting back on [unnecessary expenses](https://katebagoy.com/monthly-expenses-your-business-can-do-without/), you’ll have more money you can put in your savings account.

### **2\. Shop With Cash**

When using a debit or credit card primarily, it can be easy to lose track of how much you’re actually spending. If you use cash instead, you’ll notice how much you spend on every purchase.  Once you’ve determined your budget, you can easily set aside cash amounts for each category. For example, if you’ve budgeted $250 a month for groceries, set that amount aside and use it whenever you go to the grocery store. This can help you prevent overspending.

### **3\. Sell Unused Items**

If you find yourself accumulating items you never use, consider selling them to make some extra cash. With online marketplaces like Craigslist, eBay, and Facebook Marketplace, it’s never been easier to advertise the items you want to sell. On top of that, you can also host a yard sale, allowing you to connect with buyers in your area. In addition to making extra money you can save, selling unused items is a great way to keep your house clean and clutter-free.

### **4\. Avoid Brand-Name Items**

When shopping at the grocery store, you’ll have plenty of opportunities to choose a more cost-effective product. Aside from the price, many brand-name items are indiscernible from their generic counterparts. Whether it’s over-the-counter medications, groceries, or toiletries, many stores offer their own brand for a fraction of the cost. By choosing these cheaper products, you can easily cut down on your monthly grocery bill, allowing you to save more money.

### **5\. Automate Your Savings**

Lastly, automating your savings is one of the easiest ways to ensure you’re saving money. Many payroll and bank services allow you to set aside a predetermined amount of money every paycheck or month.  By enabling these features in alignment with your budget, you can be sure your money is saved before you have the chance to spend it. This can help you build up your savings or an emergency fund in case of an [economic crisis](https://katebagoy.com/how-to-make-sure-your-business-survives-an-economic-crisis/).
