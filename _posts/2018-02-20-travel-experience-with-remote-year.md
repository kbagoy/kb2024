After 13-months of travel as a digital nomad (initially with Remote Year, then solo) I look back at my year abroad. It's changed me more than I could have imagined... but everyone always wants to know "what's your favorite country..." So here you go. My favorite travel experiences involve nature, animals and people in Thailand, Australia and Cambodia. Get the deets on my favorite travel adventures here:
