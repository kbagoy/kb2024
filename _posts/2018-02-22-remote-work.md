Ahh, a life filled with beaches and tropical islands...

_While life as a digital nomad is certifiably NOT a vacation everyday - it's living your daily life with exotic backdrops - it certainly beats life inside a cubicle._

And it's been proven (by people a lot smarter than me) that remote workers are happier workers.

### If you've been considering leaving your job to enjoy a location-independent lifestyle, there are really two paths forward:

1. **Start a business** that will support your lifestyle
2. **Find a remote job** that will support your lifestyle

Seems like these days everyone wants to over complicate this "digital-nomad" thing and make it into a movement and a particular "skill" you need.

_"Digital Nomad" is not a job title, career or position._

Truth is, a digital nomad is simply someone that has the ability to earn a living online and chooses to travel full-time instead of have a traditional home.

_**There are no rules or requirement other than the gumption to pack your life into a suitcase and find a way to make it work.**_

So if you're thinking you'd like to try this life, and you're not ready to start a business - DON'T.

Some people are not meant to be in business for themselves, and that is OKAY.

There is nothing wrong with you if you don't want to start a business, and **you do NOT have to be an entrepreneur to work remotely and enjoy the location-independent lifestyle**.

Simply start looking for remote work! There are a TON of resources out there for this, but I've posted a few favorite links for finding remote jobs below:
