## Want to change your life? Read a book!

Today is my birthday, so I can’t help but think back on my life. If life is a movie, mine has been an epic tale full of adventures, plot twists, and a LOT of character development. I come from a loving but dysfunctional family and have survived alcoholism, abuse, bullying, heart-break, crippling depression and a host of other shit. _I spent years drinking myself to sleep, trying desperately to please people and hating myself._ **Now, I wake up (most days) genuinely excited and grateful to be alive, I’m running my second 6-figure business, have friends around the world, and get to travel as a digital nomad.** Next week I head to Mexico City and then on to South America, visiting more places I drooled over back when I was a 7-year old kid obsessed with National Geographic magazine. **Usually, when someone asks me how I've done any of those things, I think “read a damn book, bro.”** Now, I’m not going to pretend that I am perfect, or even that I have my shit together most of the time. I mean, last week I dried my face on clothes because I forgot I’d left all the towels in the washer the night before. _But, even when I’m a hot mess, I’m usually a pretty happy hot mess._ Which was NOT always the case. I thought I'd write and epic post about all the things I've learned, but when I sat down to write, I kept coming back to the same 3 things:

## 1\. Mind Your Own Business & Don't Take Anything Personally.

Basically, you do you. _You can't control what anyone else says or does._ And what they think of you is none of your business. Besides, most people are too busy thinking about themselves to be thinking about you. _And if they ARE in your business, it's probably 'cause they can't stand to think about their own lives - it ain't about you._ So let that shit go.

## 2\. If You Want to Change Your Life, Make a Decision & Take Action

Stop overthinking, overcomplicating, overanalyzing, focusing on what could go wrong or trying to get everything right. _You'll never get it perfect, so you may as well get it done._ Let go of how you'll do it / get it / be it - and simply decide you WILL. Take action everyday until you figure it out and get what you want. And you will.

## 3\. Learn From Those Who've Gone Before You

Maybe it's changing careers, losing weight, finding a better job, quitting a bad habit, starting a business, running a marathon, overcoming a devastating loss or a breakup, moving to another country... _Whatever you want to do, chances are someone else has done it before._ Ask them how they did it and take the shortcut to success. If you don't have someone in your life who can help, Google that shit, hire a coach or read a book! There's a book on nearly anything you could imagine (and some you probably can't). If you allow it, some might even change your life. Below is list of 41 that have changed mine (and a handful more [here)](https://katebagoy.com/7-books-that-may-change-your-life/). XOXO PS The list is In loose alphabetical order, because classifying by category = hard, and me = lazy. Enjoy.
