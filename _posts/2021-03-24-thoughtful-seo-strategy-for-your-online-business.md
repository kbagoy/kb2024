Your business's SEO plan is about more than just rising in the ranks on Google. A carefully implemented and thoughtful SEO strategy can help your business shine in multiple areas. Because of the time-consuming load that is required by SEO, many businesses try to rush through the various tasks involved. It’s important that you take the time to do it right. However, if you take your time, you’ll find that many of these tasks involve vital improvements to your business’s appearance, efficiency, and brand. They are things you need to do anyways, and it’s better if you get it done right the first time.

## Build Credibility

[Credibility is everything](https://www.seobox.com.au/seo-build-brand-credibility/#:~:text=In%20the%20eyes%20of%20the,the%20front%20of%20people's%20minds.) in the business world. If consumers or other businesses don’t believe that you have expertise or ethics, your business is going to struggle obtaining and maintaining client relationships. Most people will only trust the first few results on a search engine. If they don’t find their answer, they’ll try a different search. That means if you don’t rank high on the results, you’ll never be seen. This is because you aren’t viewed as credible by the searcher. A solid SEO strategy will focus on a modern website design, efficient organization, and valuable content. These items will appeal to search engine algorithms and increase your ranking, they will also appeal to those that visit your website. A sleek design and informative content will help visitors see that you are a business that cares about its reputation.

## Generate Your Own Leads

Without customers, your business is just a drain for money. Getting customers can be difficult and costly. While you can pay people to bring you leads, it’s better if you can find those leads on your own. For example, you can pay a search engine to rank you on the first page. While you will get noticed, your website is going to be flagged with an Ad symbol. You’ll have to pay each time someone clicks on your ad. Buying leads[can be costly over the long-term](https://www.podium.com/article/reverse-mortgage-leads/) for your business. If you focus on boosting your SEO, you’ll rank high without having to pay for it or having that Ad symbol attached to your result.

## Increased Engagement and Traffic

If you are a small business, it’s highly unlikely that your SEO can compete with the big players in your industry at a national or world scale. However, you don’t need to. A thoughtful SEO strategy is going to focus on reaching individuals searching within the area that you serve. By focusing your efforts in this manner, you won’t be wasting money on rising in the rankings for people outside your service area. Instead, you’ll be rising in the rankings of people that you can actually convert to clients. Not only is this more efficient in terms of client conversion, but is also easier. There will be less competition for rankings at the local search level.[To promote engagement](https://www.webfx.com/internet-marketing/is-SEO-important-for-every-business.html) on the local level, you should start off by optimizing your social media and your Google My Business accounts. These are easy steps to take that don’t require a lot of expertise. When it comes to your SEO, it’s your goal—and responsibility—to ensure that you can do what’s necessary to keep things running smoothly. Carefully making a plan and staying up-to-date with your website’s content will help your online business presence to succeed. **Need help marketing your business?[Get my step-by-step guide today!](https://go.katebagoy.com/ebook)**
