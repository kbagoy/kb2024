This week I dive into a little bit about decision making, managing emotions and the mindset behind running a business and staying in business when things go awry in your personal life.

Taking CONSISTENT action is really key when you want to create a life you love or create something new.

I'll talk about how you can use existing success strategies to get what you want and why you need to learn to compartmentalize to ensure you keep moving forward...

And, in a twist of fate, I deal with crazy wind and helicopters and have to manage my emotions while making the video.
