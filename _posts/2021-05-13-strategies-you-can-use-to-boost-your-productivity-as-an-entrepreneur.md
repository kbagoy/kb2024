Being an entrepreneur is hard work, especially when you’re first getting started and struggling with productivity. There’s a lot of work to do, and at least initially the vast majority of it has to be done by you. Because of that, you need to be able to manage your time and stay productive. Fortunately, there are some strategies you can use to boost your productivity.

## **The Pomodoro Method**

It may sound counterintuitive, but taking regular breaks can help you be more productive. That’s the idea that the Pomodoro method is based on. To use the Pomodoro method, set a timer for a predetermined amount of time during which you will work, [typically 25 minutes](https://www.focusboosterapp.com/the-pomodoro-technique). When the timer goes off, you take a short break, after which you go to work for another 25 minutes. The idea is that when you take regular breaks, you give yourself a chance to relax and refresh yourself mentally, which will help you focus better and make better use of your time while you’re working.

## **5S**

For the most part, people tend to be more productive when they’re operating in an organized environment. The [five steps in the 5S strategy](https://www.creativesafetysupply.com/qa/kaizen/what-is-the-difference-between-5S-and-kaizen) can be especially helpful for organizing your space. They help you identify areas where you can do better, figure out how to do better, create standard operating procedures for doing better, and maintain your state of doing better. In short, it’s a tool that you can use to have a place for everything and make sure that everything is in its place. That way you’ll have a place to work where you know where everything is so you don’t have to waste time trying to find things.

## **Self Care**

Arguably one of the most important strategies you can use to boost your productivity is self-care, specifically in terms of making sure that your basic needs for maintaining your health are met. That means making sure you’re [getting enough sleep](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/sleep/getting-better-sleep.htm), exercising, and eating a balanced diet. It’s a lot easier to do good work and stay focused and productive when you feel healthy, alert, and energized. If you find yourself lacking the energy to maintain your productivity, take a look at how you’re taking care of yourself and see if there’s an area that could stand to be improved.

Having strategies you can use to boost your productivity can be especially helpful as an entrepreneur. Making use of the Pomodoro method and 5S, as well as taking care of yourself can be very useful tools if you use them right. It may take some trial and error, but work to find the tools that work best for you so you can maintain an optimal level of productivity.
