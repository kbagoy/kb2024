When you travel full-time, people seem to think that you're on an extended vacation...

_But the truth for me is that I work just as hard, or harder, than I ever did at home._

I just have more scenic, ever-changing backdrops.

This week I talk a little about what I do and how you might be able to take your business online so you can travel...

Or whether your should consider finding a remote job instead of starting a business.
