When you travel full-time, people seem to think that you're on an extended vacation... _But the truth for me is that I work just as hard, or harder, than I ever did at home._ I just have more scenic, ever-changing backdrops. This week I talk a little about what I do and how you might be able to take your business online so you can travel... Or whether your should consider finding a remote job instead of starting a business.

  P.S. If you want to run a freelance business, be sure to check out my [Ebook](https://go.katebagoy.com/ebook) on getting started.
