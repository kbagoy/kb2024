AI is revolutionising the world of business. Industries of all different descriptions are capitalising on the latest advancements that are [helping to boost productivity](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/boosting-productivity-ai-how-artificial-intelligence-changing-jean/) and efficiency in so many different ways. But as a freelancer, it’s unlikely that you’ll receive any kind of formal training with these tools, so it can be difficult to know what AI can do for you and just how to optimise your use of it. In this guide, we explore three ways in which you can leverage artificial intelligence to help you optimise your time and streamline your workflow as a freelancer.

## Automating repetitive tasks

As a freelancer, you’ll be all too familiar with those time-sapping repetitive tasks that take your attention away from the crux of your professional duties. Unfortunately, these simple yet monotonous chores are often unavoidable aspects of being a freelancer, from organising invoices each month to managing your emails.

With the help of AI technology, you have the ability to automate some of these tasks that need doing on a regular basis, freeing up more of your time to focus on your primary output. For example, when it comes to invoices, AI can provide you with smart templates that can track your expenses, while also linking to time tracking tools to ensure you’re charging for your time accurately. In addition, some tools can help you to manage your inbox by automatically filtering out unhelpful emails, while also having the capacity to create content and suggest subject lines when writing your own.

## Creative inspiration

Whether you’re a copywriter, graphic designer or any other kind of creative freelancer, running out of ideas can be a major barrier to productivity. With the ability to analyse data and patterns, AI can [enhance problem-solving capabilities](https://www.forbes.com/sites/benjaminlaker/2022/08/24/how-leaders-are-using-ai-as-a-problem-solving-tool/) by helping freelancers identify new and creative solutions that they might not be able to see themselves.

In addition, certain tools can be used to generate ideas for blogs, designs or just about any other kind of creative digital outlet. By making the most of AI, you too will be able to unlock your full creative potential, even on the days where imagination is harder to come by.

## Time management

When it comes to time management, it can be most effective to combine human influence with the use of AI to ensure you’re optimising your time as best you can. For example, you may already [utilise the services of a call handler](https://www.jam.co.uk/call-handling-services/) or virtual assistant so you never miss out on an opportunity for work. But alongside this human element, you could consider using planning and scheduling tools that can automatically accept or divert calls/messages depending on whether or not the correspondence is during your working hours.

You can integrate smart AI technologies into your digital calendar to help you prioritise your time effectively and automatically reschedule any conflicts to streamline your workflow and maximise your opportunity for work.

## Get a headstart with AI

No matter which industry you specialise in, it’s clear that AI could have a part to play in helping you to maximise your potential and income as a freelancer. Test out some of these tools for yourself and see how you could streamline your workflow.
