**Freelancing is a $1.4 TRILLION industry.** That’s 12 zeros. A million million. A heap of money, really. **And some of that pie could easily be yours, aspiring freelancer.** And it’s not contingent on your being the best at what you do. It’s having the ability to CONSISTENTLY bring new clients in the door that will allow you to scale your income & live the lifestyle you want. **Everyone knows a freelancer who’s always struggling to make ends meet.** The one that can never seem to pay bills and always seems to have a client from hell? **Or maybe this has been you in the past** \- you started freelancing and spent dozens of hours writing proposals on freelancer.com or Upwork, then got a bunch of clients that wanted lower rates and worked you to the bone?  Stories like this are incredibly common, and probably one of the biggest reasons people are afraid to leave their jobs to start freelancing.  But**if you're seeking location independence or financial freedom, you're not likely to get either working a day job**.  **So how do you become a successful freelancer** and, ultimately an online entrepreneur, without the constant struggle? **_There is ONE super important thing you MUST do before you start your business if you want to be a profitable freelancer._** Are you ready for it? **You MUST stop thinking like an employee who’s embarking on an extended job search & start thinking like a business owner.** Simple, right?  Yet, 8 times out of 10, when I meet someone who's struggling with freelancing they still have an employee mindset keeping them stuck.  _They're not running a business - they're just searching for jobs._ **Here's what broke freelancers do to struggle:**

* They sell their skills as commodities rather than providing services
* They use their resume to try to capture the sale
* They spend more time “looking for projects” than promoting
* They have no marketing strategy, a poor web presence and no processes
* They think sales is a dirty word and suck at talking about what they do
* They do everything for their business fast, cheap and, frankly, half-assed

Don’t be _^^that_ freelancer.  **Here's what business owners do differently:**

* Sell services to their clients, not their resume
* Know who their client is and what they need (a TARGET MARKET and a NICHE, respectively)
* Fall in love with their clients and create solutions that serve them
* Know how to talk to clients in their language and how to “talk business”
* Compete on expertise and results rather than cost, quantity or speed
* Adopt a testing mindset and aim for constant improvement, not perfection or praise
* Spend their time building a brand and selling versus searching for “gigs”
* And 8 out of 10 small business owners value regular coaching, according to recent [Robbins Research Study](https://www.tonyrobbins.com/career-business/2020-business-mindset-report)

_This same study showed that 77% of small business owners believe they will be able to grow their business through the next recession, even though they are less sure about how they will do so._ The great new is you don't have to know exactly what to do to grow your business - you just need to know the next step. **Adopt a business owner mindset instead and start investing time, money and energy into building a business instead of searching for jobs.** Want a piece of the $1.4 Trillion freelance market? I've helped helped dozens of corporate creatives quit their jobs and reach 6-figures their first year of business. Would you like to learn how?
