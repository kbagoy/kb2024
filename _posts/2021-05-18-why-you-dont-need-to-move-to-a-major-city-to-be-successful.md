When people imagine growing up and beginning their adult life, they always imagine a  move to a  major city. While large cities have many opportunities to offer, they are not the only road to success. Suburban areas and small towns are becoming homes for small businesses and freelance workers.

## **There’s Promise in Smaller Cities**

Every large city was once small. More sky risers filled with more people does not mean that the major city is better. According to [SpareFoot](https://www.sparefoot.com/), if you move to a small city, there is more job security because you have less competition, and they will often appreciate your work more. In a way, smaller cities are similar to being a part of a start-up business because you will have the opportunity to be part of something bigger than yourself and watch it grow. You can also use the closer-knit atmosphere to your advantage if you start a small business and build connections with those around you.

## **Physical Location is Less Important**

As companies move online and technology becomes more readily available, it is also becoming much easier to work or go to school remotely. As an employee, you can work thousands of miles away from your physical office and communicate online-there's less need to move to a major city these days.  According to [DaVinci](https://www.davincivirtual.com/), as the employer, you can secure a virtual office with an address in any major city you want. Your permanent address does not dictate where you need to work.  People can be connected through the internet and still be productive. In many cases, workers find that they are more productive when they work remotely.

## **Save Your Money**

Living in a large city comes with a price, quite literally. Major cities tend to have a large cost of living, meaning that although you might get paid more, you are keeping less of your income because you are trying to finance yourself. According to [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.nl/), in a small town or city, food, gas, and housing are often more cost-effective. If you are working remotely, you can use that same income you would have in the city to fund a much nicer home where you plan to move. You can also save money on gas because everything is closer together and your car will have lower mileage than if you lived in a city.

Successful living is no longer confined to the big cities. You can live a full life with a good income anywhere you want, from small towns to state capitols or while traveling. Dreaming big does not mean you have to live big.
