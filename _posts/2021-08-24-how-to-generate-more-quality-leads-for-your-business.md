Generating better leads for your business can take a lot of work and thought. While you may think the most effective results are singularly through advertising efforts, this isn’t necessarily true. You can find better leads in more practical ways without needing to spend a ton on advertising. Here’s how you can do it!

## **Rely on Current Customers**

First, you should talk with your customers and see what they like about your brand. What do they like about your product? What problems are they thankful that it solves? This can give you a better idea of who you should be marketing to in the first place. You shouldn’t shy away from asking for referrals and advice from your customers as well. Incentives for referral-focused customers (such as coupons or free visits) are an excellent way to find new people all the time! Your customers will know people who also struggle with the same issues they do, and asking them to [pass on your information](https://www.practiceignition.com/us/blog/how-to-get-referrals) can offer fruitful results.

## **Create a Sales Funnel**

You should always be trying to get potential customers into the “sales funnel.” This process may sound super official, but it is actually multiple different casual events that lead up to a loyal customer. In order to be considered a prospect, a potential customer [must fall within your target audience](https://www.podium.com/article/sales-prospecting/). The next step is to contact your customer. This can be a simple initial contact that revolves around smiling and kindness. As their interest is piqued over time, you can extend an offer to them. Resolve their concerns, and then you can close the sale! Make sure you are always taking people through this funnel.

## **Attend Networking Events**

Another solid way at getting brand-new contacts is through networking. While it may seem like events like this are stuck because of the pandemic, you can still [attend virtual networking events](https://empowering-brands.com/2020/08/21/why-you-should-attend-virtual-networking-events/) to meet new businesses and attempt to strike a deal with them. B2B marketing is an effective way to cement your position in the local community and can keep your business alive. Even if you aren’t able to attend an event, never stop finding ways to network with those around you. Bring a business card with you wherever you go. All in all, your ability to lock down future clients will highly depend on your foresight. Don’t take anything for granted, and always be on the lookout for the next potential customer. It’s the way to keep your company afloat through everything.   **Find out my best secrets to business success**[**in my book**](https://go.katebagoy.com/ebook)**!**
