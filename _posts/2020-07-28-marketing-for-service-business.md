To illustrate what this means to create your service-centric company stand out, let us think about an example. Envision a guy called X who is in desperate need of advertising services to advertise his articles. But after going through hundreds of sites and testimonials, X continues to perform the task himself, because nothing that he came around had caught his attention. Regrettably, most clients share the same debate as X, together with a lot of services advertised at precisely the same dull and predictable manner. With that said, many service-vendors find it hard to differentiate themselves from their competitors. That's why every time a comprehensive self-analysis is useful.
