If you don’t keep track of the finances in your business, there is a lot of room for error. It’s important to keep your finances in order to keep everything running smoothly. To ensure everything goes well, be sure to keep track of these important numbers.

## **Your Expenses**

When you’re running a business, you need to keep track of your expenses. Not knowing how much your company is spending can cause potential damage to your company. Expenses are necessary costs that it takes to run your business. You need to pay for a business space, a website domain, a payment portal, the acquisition of your products, and more. These expenses allow you to run your business, but if you don’t keep track of your expenses, you can end up spending too much and [damage your bottom line](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/15745-business-expenses-you-should-track.html). Spending too much on expenses puts your business in the red. If your expenses outweigh your profits, you’ll continue to go deeper and deeper into debt until you’re forced to close your business. Keeping track of your expenses keeps you on top of all your business’ finances.

## **Profits**

Your profits are another big number to keep track of within your business. Your profits allow you to continue to pay for and run your business, and provide a livelihood for yourself and your employees. To find your profits, subtract your various expenses from your revenue. Any remaining funds are the profits you’ve made from the sale. You should also understand the [difference between profitability and profit](https://ppmanagement.com/2022/04/11/profitability-tracking-and-management-everything-you-need-to-know-about-how-to-keep-track-of-profits/). Profit is a fixed amount. You’ll know the exact amount that you received to pay your employees and yourself. However, profitability is an estimation of the profit your business can receive in relation to its size. 

## **Payroll**

Without a strong group of employees, your business cannot succeed. It’s impossible to run a successful business all by yourself. You need a team of hardworking employees to make a business successful. It’s critically important to treat your employees well if you want to retain them, and a big part of that is payroll. It’s essential for you to stay on top of your employees’ salaries to pay them for their hard work and keep your company running smoothly. Luckily, [there are hundreds of software programs](https://www.companionlink.com/blog/2021/09/how-to-better-manage-and-keep-track-of-your-employees-payroll-checks/) that make keeping track of payroll easy.
