I don't know who needs to hear this, but..

**You have the right to change your mind.**

Okay, it was me. I needed to hear this.

But just for funsies, repeat after me:

_**"I have the right to change my mind."**_

You are not obligated to keep doing things that aren't working for you in order to impress, inspire or get the approval of anyone else.

You have ONE little lifetime in your current human suit, so you might as well do more of what you love!

_Letting go of something that isn't working for you is a win, not a failure._

This is what I've been telling myself for the last few week as I contemplated dropping a big bomb on my clients, my audience, my friends...

See, every once in a while I like to burn things to the ground so I can rise like a Phoenix from the ashes.

Now is one of those times, so here goes:

_**I've decided to exit the coaching business.**_

\*\*GASP\*\*

Hold-up don't leave yet! I'm not shuttering completely, just hear me out.

First, the why.

Long story short...

2020 hit me like a metric ton of bricks.

I'm not gonna go into details, but it was a FANTASTIC opportunity to:

- Practice letting go of things I can't control
- Deal with childhood trauma & self-defeating BS
- Evaluate my priorities

**_I was starting to feel more excited and clear about my life & business than I ever had before and started making HUGE plans._**

Then, I got the covid.

I've had symptoms for over 7 months now, and while I'm much better today, I completely lost momentum in my business.

_Turns out if you don't market yourself or can't take on clients, a coaching practice is a bitch to keep running._

More importantly, I realized I'm no longer interested in doing what I was doing before I got sick.

**I got into business to help people, but somewhere along the way I became a marketer.**

I became obsessed with growth hacking and funnel design and traffic generation and capturing keywords.

While I'm pretty good at it, and it's an important part of growing a business, it's not how I want to live on a daily basis.

Sure, I could hire a team, but as an introvert, I don't want to build or run a big company... nor do I want to be on video calls 10-20 hours per week. I want more time to rest & create in quiet.

So, I'm going back to product design & pivoting my brand.

I still want to help people, particularly people starting businesses, but not as a full-time coach.

For now, I'm focused on finding a freelance or contract role, but I'm even open to FT for the 1st time in years.

Having some killer healthcare coverage doesn't sound like a bad thing after the last 6-months! Plus, **after 5-years of self-employment, I honestly miss having a team to work with!**

_I miss working on projects that have a deadline and taking a week off where I don't think about work. I miss collaborating with other designers & product people, and celebrating launches over tacos._

But I felt some shame around sharing this with you.

I mean, my entire brand is based around thriving financially and how to "design a life & business you love."

Now I'm telling ya I'm not so much loving my biz, nor thriving financially.

ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£

_But... I guess, in a weird way, this is my way of talking the talk and walking the walk._

I've gotten clarity around what I want, and I'm taking action.

It's scary. It's uncertain. But I know it's the right thing for me.

_I have the right to change my mind._

**Here's what you can expect over the next few months:**

**1.** Six Figure Freelancers will be relaunching later this year as 6FF Pro, and that will be where most of my energy will be focused.

I'll be leading group coaching calls each month, adding more trainings, and bringing in experts for skills training.

I'm behind due to my energy issues, but if you want to be part of our first group [you can join the waitlist here](http://sixfigurefreelancers.com/waitlist).

**2.** Once the launch is done, my part-time hobby will be creating passive income streams - and more content for you!

In fact, I've just completed the design on a planner for entrepreneurs that combines techniques from my morning routine, favorite productivity techniques and a bunch of woo-woo stuff I've gotten into the last few years, like Law of Attraction.

It'll be up on Amazon soon so stay tuned!

**3.** As I figure my ish out, I'm offering instant booking sessions on SuperPeer and for a limited time I've added donation-based coaching.

My scheduled will change as I take on design work, so go ahead and [fill my calendar up while you can](https://superpeer.com/kbagoy), I dare ya!

**4.** I want to bring in experts to teach skills to the 6FF Pro community on a monthly or quarterly basis. Stuff like generating passive income, growth hacking, copywriting, design... anything helpful to a micro-business owner.

If that's you, [get in touch](/contact) and let me know what you'd want to teach on for an hour - you'll get a little bit of cash, some street cred, an invite to become an affiliate partner and a lot of love from me.

**5.** We'll be updating katebagoy.com to reflect our new focus, but we're dedicated to adding more content and resources for you.

If you have a requested topic you'd like me to cover, reach out. And please be patient -Â  I apologize in advance if I break something and you get a pesky 404 error

**Finally, if you're still reading... thank you!**

I imagine you've probably been following me (& all my mis-adventure) for awhile if you've made it this far.

I don't know exactly how this pivot is gonna play out, but but I hope you stick around to watch the story unfold.

XOXO,

Kate
