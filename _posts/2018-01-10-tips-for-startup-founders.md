1. **Pay yourself first, always.** Founders that bootstrap are far more likely to struggle, suffer from burnout and quit when things get hard. Pay yourself first, and pay yourself well, if you want to go the distance.
2. **Hire fast. Fire Faster** A good hire can accelerate your growth - even a personal assistant can make the difference between burnout and brilliant. But a bad employee can destroy moral at a startup faster than anything else, and kill your progress.
3. **Know your why AND you company’s why** Your personal 'why' is going to shape all the decision you make at the beginning of your company's growth, and help you determine what steps to take first. Your company why will act as the north star for all your employees and will ensure that your _customers needs_ are always considered first.
4. **Focus on you Zone of Genius** Chances are, you have some natural talents that are going to help you shine as a leader. And you've also got some "areas of improvement." But just because you're the boss doesn't mean you have to do it all. Focus more time doing what you enjoy & outsource the rest so you're at your best.
5. **Fail Often, Fail Quickly** It's okay to fail, but do it quickly - forgive yourself, learn from it and move on. Constant and never-ending improvement is the key to lean methodology, and when you work with me I'll challenge you to consistently launch before you're ready, make faster decisions and learn to trust your instincts.  

**Bonus Tip (but probably the most important): Have fun! This is your business - if you ain't enjoying it, get the heck out before it grows!**
