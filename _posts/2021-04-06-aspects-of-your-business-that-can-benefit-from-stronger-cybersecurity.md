Strong cybersecurity is vital to running a successful business. From competitors to disgruntled consumers, businesses face a lot of things that could easily be labeled as threats. Marketing and customer service are the most common tools businesses have at their disposal to deal with those, but what about the ones you can’t see? Hackers and viruses can take advantage of vulnerabilities in a variety of aspects of businesses. You’ll need proactive cybersecurity if you’re to protect your business.

## **Customer Data**

When customers interact with your business, they often end up sharing a fair amount of data with you. They do so because they trust you to protect it. According to [Data Privacy Manager](https://dataprivacymanager.net/data-breach-and-reputation-management/), failing to protect customer data has a myriad of unpleasant results, not the least of which is how it harms your reputation as a business. Having strong cybersecurity protecting customer data suggests that you value your customers enough to have their interests in mind as well as your own. Don’t store data unless it’s necessary, and make sure what you do store is encrypted to help keep it protected.

## **Accounting**

Your customers aren’t the only ones you need to protect. You need to protect your business accounts too. You can have the best customer data protection in the world, but if you don’t do the same for your accounting and financial accounts, you could be dangerously vulnerable. The good news is that you don’t necessarily have to come up with your security all by yourself. According to [Quarium](https://quariumhosting.com/resources/blog/why-use-third-party-hosting-for-quick-books), third-party Quickbooks hosting can lead to better security. Outsourcing your cybersecurity to people who are experts in the field can give you a leg up when it comes to protecting your business.

## **Online Payment Processing**

Some of the most sensitive customer data you end up with is data you collect during payment processing. This information can potentially be used to compromise your customers’ financial information and even steal their identity. Protecting your online payment processing system is critical. Encourage your customers to set up accounts with your business that they can perform transactions with. According to [GCF Global](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/internetsafety/creating-strong-passwords/1/), you can get your customers involved in their security by requiring them to set up secure passwords that are less likely to be vulnerable to hackers.

Protecting your business should be a top priority. Strong cybersecurity can help protect customer data, your accounting, and online payment processing systems. If you aren’t sure how to best go about protecting your business from cyber threats, take the time to consult an expert so you can develop an understanding of the best way to move forward.
