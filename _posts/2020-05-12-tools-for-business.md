Every business is on a constant quest to get to know their customers better. Doing so comes with multiple benefits, including building stronger relationships, increasing brand awareness, and having a better idea of the type of person who is more likely to shop at your store.

Thankfully, there are many tools that can be used in order to better get to know your customers. I've got a whole list of [business tools and software here](https://katebagoy.com/tools/) - but for now, let's focus on the basics...

# Simple Ways to Get to Know Your Customers Better

## 1\. Talk to Them

Sometimes, the simpler the better. Try something as plain as just talking to your customers. More importantly, listen to them. Engage them in a real conversation. Don't try to sell anything to them, just build a relationship with them. This will allow you to have a better understanding of who they are and what their needs are. It is only through this communication and conversations that you will actually get to know your customers on a deeper level.

## 2\. Gather Data

Thankfully, our increased reliance on digital services leaves us with a slew of data to analyze. Analyzing data will allow you to discover trends that can help you understand your customers. To that end, take a look at your website and point-of-sales information. Who are your customers? What do they usually purchase? What types of products do they seem the most interested in? Where are they coming from? It’s important to take this data and analyze it further. It may even be worth purchasing additional information from major marketing companies on likely demographics for your business.

## 3\. Check Your Social Media Analytics

All social media platforms have basic analytics available to their users. Understanding what the information available means can be complicated, but with proper study, it can be done. At the bare minimum, social media analytics can help you determine what sort of customer is using social media to access your page. This data can be used in many ways. For example, if you notice a certain demographic views your social media, and you know what type of products that demographic usually likes, you can alter your social media accordingly.

As a small business owner, it’s vital that you get to know your customers. Sometimes, it's simply a matter of listening to them. Other times, you may need to gather data or use social media analytics to dive a little deeper. However you go about it, what’s important is that you create lasting relationships with your customers and it will all go uphill from there.
