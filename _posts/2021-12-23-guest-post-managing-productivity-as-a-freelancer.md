## Break Bigger Tasks Into Smaller Ones

Consider dividing your bigger tasks into smaller ones to make your work easier and stress-free. You can allot different days for different tasks or split the same job into different days.

For instance, if you are working on a research paper, allocate separate days for literature review and background and then manage data collection, discussion, conclusion, etc.

The smaller your task is divided, the more specific your work will be, and the more specific your work is, the better your accuracy will be. By this work specification, the focus is narrowed down and will eventually result in better outputs.

## Take Short Breaks

Working tirelessly without taking any breaks can never result in productivity; instead, it will have adverse effects on productivity, and you will end up delivering terrible work. According to reports, short breaks during work improves efficiency and recharge your capacities.

This might seem a paradox to you, but in truth, working for too long without any breaks is your worst enemy in generating quality work. 

When you work straight for more than four hours, your level of focus deteriorates, resulting in the decreased excellence of your work.

However, the break doesn't mean hour-long breaks. Instead, you can take a lunch break, go for a short walk, or pause for a rest.

## Cut Down Social Media Time While Working

The biggest and the cruelest practice that can decelerate your productivity is using [social media](https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/social-media-while-working-from-home/) while working. No doubt, social media can bring you a lot of pros too, but this one con is above all. 

Social media brings distractions and is considered as one of the biggest enemies of productivity. If you think you can work efficiently surfing around social media, let me be clear, you cannot. 

According to [Dissertation Editing Services](https://assignmentassistance.co.uk/dissertation-editing-services), the biggest barrier they face while working on their tasks is social media. To curb this, most of them recommend disabling notifications and enabling silent mode, so they don't peek at their phones, which ultimately will result in limited use of cell phones and social channels. 

## Use Sticky Notes For Deadlines And Reminders

Sticky notes are a great way to stay up-to-date with your goals. If you have time limits and a lot of work to do in less time, try utilizing these colorful pieces of paper or your onscreen sticky notes to remember your closing dates.

You can also add your random daily errands and keep posted about your work schedules.

## Schedule Time For The Outside World

Many freelancers limit themselves to their shells and disconnect from the outside world. This isolation brings negative impacts to the behavior, and in the long run, the person becomes lonely and detached from the social world.

Whether you are an employee, employer or freelancer, you must never overlook the outside community. Socializing improves your [professional communication](https://katebagoy.com/how-can-i-improve-my-professional-communication/), makes you welcoming and adaptable to many changes that are a must possess for professional life.

Oftentimes these interactions make your connections and expose you to your target clients that can be beneficial for both your character and professional growth.

So instead of being clung to your computer screen, go out on the town. Take out time for your family and friends and head with them to your favorite places because adhering to your monitor will [drive you crazy](https://katebagoy.com/how-to-stay-sane-while-working-from-home/), and you will lose all flexibility.

## Track Your Time And Assess Performance

Two of the best favors you can do for yourself is tracking your time and assessing the output. Track time to analyze how much time you consumed completing a single task. 

Jot your tracks for a week and see how many changes you can make. The better you keep an eye on your timings, the more focused and prudent you will become.

Also, every time you track your time, assess your performance too. Take a look to see if things went as you planned and are they worth the release. If things are according to your plans, excellent, but if not, examine where you went wrong and try to alter it. 

## Concentrate On A Single Job Than Multitasking 

It's good to multitask, but this practice sometimes can ruin all of your efforts and result in a disaster. Many freelancers work on a number of projects and bring out results that are not worthy or of no value. Make sure you are not one of those.

It's better to focus on a sole plan and produce commendable results than work on [several tasks](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/multitasking-evil-main-killer-productivity-mark-woeppel) and generate lamentable outcomes.

## Learn To Say No 

Have the guts to say no to [customers](https://katebagoy.com/3-effective-ways-to-improve-your-customer-service/) for the work you don't feel like doing or have no energy to put the effort in. It doesn't matter if your client is your friend, family, or acquaintance; if you don't have the strength to fulfill it, don't force yourself.

Remember, an understanding fellow won't impose his work on you, and the one who does is not your friend but a foe. Learn the difference.

## Pay Attention To Quality Over Quantity 

Learn by heart; no matter what, quality will always have a preference over quantity. Your worth is not determined by the number of tasks you are completing but the value of the work you are producing.

Never run after the number of orders; instead, always prefer the excellence of work.
