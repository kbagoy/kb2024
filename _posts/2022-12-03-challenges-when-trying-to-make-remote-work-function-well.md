Remote work can come with a lot of challenges if your company isn’t set up to facilitate this type of work. Although remote work can be very rewarding, and incentivize your employees to stay at your business, there are still some issues you need to work through. Here are a few challenges when trying to make remote work function well.

## **Disengaged Employees**

First, you might encounter employees that are easily distracted and disengaged as they’re working from a remote location. This is an understandable issue since it is much easier to take breaks and get distracted when you’re working in a home setting. However, there are some approaches that you can implement to help disengaged employees to become more productive and eager in their work. 

First, you can have group meetings throughout the day to check up on projects and discuss different responsibilities. You can also have your employees track their hours. This can help them to prevent their work from dragging on throughout long hours and instead motivate them to work productively in a small chunk of time. Communicating with your employees throughout the day can also [keep them engaged](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/tools-and-samples/how-to-guides/pages/how-to-engage-remote-employees-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic.aspx) and motivated.

## **Collaboration Issues**

Another issue that you might run into is the lack of collaboration when everyone is working remotely. If you never schedule team meetings or facilitate company communication, you can expect that collaboration will zero out. However, if you schedule regular collaboration and brainstorming meetings, the collaboration will increase. 

You can also encourage collaboration by opening easy communication methods for your employees. This can help them to talk about different challenges they’re working on. Installing cloud software can also help your employees easily share files and projects for collaboration purposes.

## **Security Threats**

Finally, you also might encounter some security issues as you have your employees working remotely. If they’re not using a secured, private Wi-Fi network, they might have some inconsistencies in their connection, and also run the risk of malware attacks. Instead, require that your employees have a private IP address or Wi-Fi connection to provide them with additional security. You can also make sure that all of your employees have security software installed and downloaded on their computers to prevent your valuable company information from being attacked.

You might have disengaged employees, collaboration issues, or security threats, but with the right software and approaches, you can take care of these challenges. This can help your business to be more effective and your employees to be happier as you provide a great remote work environment.
