No one wants to deal with the IRS. Unfortunately, sometimes mistakes are made, and you find yourself in trouble. But staying out of trouble can be a lot easier with a few simple pointers. Here are three tips on how to stay out of trouble with the IRS and avoid any penalties or fines. Follow these tips, and you'll be in good shape.

## **Meet your Tax Deadlines**

Everyone knows that paying taxes is a part of being a responsible adult. But what happens if you can't pay your taxes on time? The IRS has a variety of tools at its disposal to collect the money you owe, and they're not afraid to use them. That's why it's important to make sure you [meet your tax deadlines](https://www.jackscamp.com/tax-filing-deadlines-a-good-time-to-confirm-other-compliance-issues-for-businesses/). Whether you're filing an individual return or a business return, the IRS expects you to meet the April 15th deadline. 

If you can't pay the full amount owed, it's better to file your return on time and pay as much as you can. The penalties for late filing are much less than the penalties for late payment. So if you're in a tight spot, make sure you file on time and pay what you can. It may not be everything the IRS wants, but it's better than nothing.

## **Organize Your Finances**

Additionally, it will free up your time to focus on other aspects of your business. 

A professional accountant can help you keep track of your finances and ensure that you are compliant with tax laws. In addition, they can offer valuable insights into how you can improve your financial situation. By outsourcing your accounting, you can take one step toward staying out of trouble with the IRS.

## **Save Everything**

One of the best tips for avoiding trouble with the IRS is to keep meticulous records of all your financial transactions. This may seem like a tedious task, but it will be well worth it if you ever find yourself in an audit. By keeping track of all your income and expenses, you can be sure that you are accurately reporting your taxes. Additionally, [saving receipts and other documentation](https://www.freshbooks.com/blog/business-records) can help you to substantiate your deductions. While it may take some extra effort to stay organized, it is far better than dealing with the hassle and stress of an audit.

By following these three tips, you can stay out of trouble with the IRS and avoid any penalties or fines. Pay your taxes on time, keep good records, and be organized. If you do these things, you'll be in good shape come tax season. So don't wait until it's too late. Get started today!
