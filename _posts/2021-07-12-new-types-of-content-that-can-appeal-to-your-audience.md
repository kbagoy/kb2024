There are many tried and true methods for appealing to your audience through content. However, it might be time to try a new form of content creation. Audiences enjoy variety and their preference for consuming information and entertainment change over time.

## **Video Content**

For many people, videos are their preferred method of learning and being entertained. For people with busy and fast-paced lives, video content is ideal. It doesnâ€™t take as much effort to engage with the content, and it is delivered quickly. Additionally, videos allow people to make more of a connection with you and your message. You can demonstrate your personality, which draws people in more. You can also portray more emotion than in a written message. Video content is also very convenient. Aside from being easy to consume, it also works well across multiple formats. [Using video content](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/358574) for your business is the right move.

## **Podcasts**

Many businesses have turned to creating podcasts. Much like videos, podcasts are easy for consumers to access. [More than 70 percent of people](https://www.podium.com/article/36-podcast-listener-statistics/) say they listen to podcasts to learn new things. It is very common for people to turn on a podcast while commuting, cleaning, working, etc. All they need to do is listen. The benefit of having a podcast for your business is it allows you to regularly engage with your audience. A lot of businesses will have weekly episodes on their podcast. This allows you to increase your exposure to your current audience and reach out to a wider audience. If people like what they hear, they will come back for more and they will recommend your podcast to others as well.

## **Social Media**

Social media is commonly used by businesses for marketing purposes. However, it can also be used as a form of content. The content you post on social media can be used to create a brand image and to entertain your audience. For example, some brands have found success by regularly posting funny tweets. Since social media has a very wide reach, you can almost guarantee an increase in your customer base. There are many different platforms you can use, and each has millions of users. You can increase the exposure of your business and try out a new form of content to engage with your audience.
