## Why Should You Consider Building a Brand?

Building a brand is critical to the success of your small business. When implemented correctly, a good brand strategy  allows you to scale your service and offerings, acts a sales person for your business online, warms potential customers up to work with you and repels those clients from hell you don't want to work with.

There are quite a few components that go into building a brand image. Below are three of the most important yet easiest criteria to tackle.

## Brand Values

Your brand values are beliefs or morals that you and your company abide by. They serve as the map work for the operation of your company. Without clearly stated values, along with full compliance in operating under these values, your brand's image can become lost to consumers as well as employees.

Another reason brand values are important is because of customer retention. Many consumers flock to a brand because the brand's values align with their own. Not only does this boost your bottom line, but it sears your brand image into their minds.

## Consistency

According to [Harvey Agency](https://www.harveyagency.com/), consistency across the board is critical when it comes to branding your business, especially since it only takes a single second for customers to create an impression of your brand and about 5–7 impressions for your brand to become recognizable and memorable. Your brand should be consistent across the board from your logo, including colors, to your advertisements. You'll need to remember to align branding with your values because that goes along with consistency. Don't forget about your employees; their uniforms, attitudes, and motivations should all be consistent across the board, too.

## Social Media

The world has entered a time period in which social media can make or break a company, according to [Pretty Links](https://prettylinks.com/). It's no longer only about carving out your company's section in social media. Now more than ever people can share every moment and you can believe that will include interactions with your business.

As you can imagine, in these shareable moments, your brand's image should shine through. For one thing, it's free advertising. For another, information through social media travels a lot faster than word of mouth, which used to be the fastest form of advertisement. The perfect sharable moment with consistent branding can catapult your company to the top when it comes to consumer approval.

With a little effort, you can begin building your brand image easily. The three tips above aren't complicated to implement but can have tremendous results on branding. By aligning your brand with your values, staying consistent, and using social media to your advantage, you'll set your branding efforts up for success.
