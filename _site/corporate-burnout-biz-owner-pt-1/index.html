You could be suffering from corporate burnout. This is part 1 of my story of recovering from corporate burnout.</h3>

<p>PART I: SUFFERING IS A CHOICE</p>

<p>I started my corporate career in what you might describe as a “dream job.” I worked for a global sportswear company doing fun &amp; creative work, with people I loved. <em>It was amazing.</em></p>

<p>And then, slowly, it wasn’t.</p>

<p>It became a nightmare. I was working sixty to eighty hours a week. I’d come home most days to microwave a meal, binge Netflix, and drink or cry (or both!) myself to sleep.</p>

<p><strong>I knew there was more to life, but I didn’t have the energy for it.</strong></p>

<p>I kept thinking something would change. The new CEO would fix things, a different project would help… but it never did.</p>

<p>I found myself bitter and angry most of the time, which isn’t who I am at my core.</p>

<p><strong><em>I realized I was responsible for changing my life – only me – and it was a choice to continue to suffer in a job I hated, waiting for my circumstances to change.</em></strong></p>

<p>I quit that job without a plan in 2008.</p>

<p>I didn’t have savings, or know what was coming next. I don’t come from money, had a lot of student debt and no safety net. But I knew if I stayed in that job, I would end up killing myself in some manner or another.</p>

<p>I took piecemeal work to survive, and a series of corporate jobs that weren’t ideal but paid the bills and padded the resume.</p>

<p>I started to breathe a little, and to see brief flashes of a life worth living.</p>

<p>Nothing felt clear, but I took time to explore and recover, while I earned my master’s degree in business. I still thought I’d be working in the corporate world forever, and I wanted to understand what was going on in in these companies.</p>

<p>When I graduated, my plan was to move to Silicon Valley. I had a vision of a future where I’d take a job at a start-up, work for a few years, and ultimately became a project manager at Apple before doing my own thing. I was gonna be the next <a href="https://guykawasaki.com/">Guy Kawasaki</a>. It was awesome.</p>

<p>So I did it. I got a job in the Valley, and moved down. And, guess what?</p>

<p><em>It sucked.</em></p>

<p>It was worse than anything I thought could have been true about the Valley. Everything you’ve seen on HBO’s Silicon Valley is accurate. The start-up worked for was in a shitty, shitty office park with no character, sandwiched between a tire store and a Walgreens. But the parking lot was full of Maseratis and Ferraris.</p>

<p>The work wasn’t much better. We spent all of our time focusing on competitors and preparing for the next board meeting, and no time thinking about our users or audiences. I felt like we were serving no one, and really just treading water. I hated it, and I started drinking myself to sleep <em>every night</em>.</p>

<p>But there was a silver lining…</p>

<p>I got to try my hand at entrepreneurship and working in a startup, and <em>I loved it</em>.</p>

<p>I’ve always been a huge learner. I love to read, be hands-on, try new things; I loved getting my hands dirty in a million different parts of the company. I liked seeing what worked and what didn’t and testing everything.</p>

<p>Even though I was languishing in that shitty Mountain View office park, I’d found something I loved.</p>

<p>Eventually, I quit. Again, I didn’t have a set plan, but I knew I could start freelancing. It was hard.</p>

<p>I struggled a lot, flailing for piecemeal work, and didn’t know who I was targeting. I didn’t think about my work as a viable business, but as a mix of short-term projects that would pay the bills.</p>

<p>Or not.</p>

<p>I was stressed out all the fucking time, and I didn’t have good coping mechanisms at the time. I smoked and drank and ate and binged, because I didn’t know better ways to manage my stress.</p>

<p><strong>Whether it’s alcohol, drugs, food, online shopping, or something else, we can all fall into the trap of unhealthy coping mechanisms.</strong></p>

<p>To be effective as an entrepreneur, we have to quit these. I learned that the hard way.</p>

<p>During a particularly challenging period I realized my problem with alcohol was beyond poor coping and I made the decision to quit behavior that didn’t serve me. I found the resources I needed to quit drinking, started focusing on self-care, learned how to recover from corporate burnout - and stopped shaming myself.</p>

<p><strong><em>My entire world changed with that decision.</em></strong></p>

<p>By making changes to what I put in my body, how I lived my life and how I treated myself physically, I started to recover from my corporate burnout… and, more importantly, I started to return to being a happy human being. I started to feel healthier and more vibrant, and was kinder to my body and mind. I had more energy to pour into my business and into my life.</p>

<p>In retrospect, it might seem quick to sum up these changes, but <strong><em>they.were.so.hard.</em></strong></p>

<p>During this time, I dug myself into a financial hole. I had to short-sell my home and move into my friend’s basement. It was brutal, and it’s taken a long time to get out of the deep financial hole I dug. But through it all, I learned. I got closer to who I wanted to work with and, more importantly, who I <em>didn’t</em> want to work with.</p>

<p>Along the way, I took a full-time job to start getting myself out of my financial hole. I liked the project and the people; it was good work, a dream job by many other people’s standards. I was – and still am – passionate about the project, and it was a crucial stepping stone to where I am now, but it just wasn’t <em>it</em>.</p>

<p>Not yet.</p>
