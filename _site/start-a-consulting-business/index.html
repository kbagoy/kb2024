    <p>It’s November 2017, and I’m sitting in the Milk &amp; Madu cafe in Canggu, Bali, with my housemate Alice, sweating our asses off in the tropical heat. </p>

<p>The fans slowly turn overhead, plates clatter, and keyboards clack as 100’s of nomads dig into their healthy breakfasts of avocado toast, gluten-free waffles, and acai bowls before starting their workday. </p>

<p>God, I miss the days when we could go out in public, don’t you?</p>

<p>Anyway, Alice is an event planner based out of Dubai, but she’s taken a sabbatical because she’s burnt out.  She’s tired of working for a crazy boss, sitting in meetings, and dealing with corporate BS. </p>

<p><strong>Alice thinks she wants to start a consulting business, but she’s overwhelmed AF.</strong></p>

<p>I’d been traveling full-time for about a year at this point and running a business for 3, so she’s quizzing me about how I find clients, how I work remotely, how I got over the horrible fear of starting my own business…</p>

<p>And as we’re talking and I’m guiding her into a potential path forward with her own business, I realize there are many more people out there like Alice. </p>

<p>People out there who hate working in corporate America. </p>

<p>People who are tired of endless meetings and walking through miles of cubicle farms to get their coffee.</p>

<p>People who are sick of eating lunch at their desk, feeling under-appreciated… and trapped.</p>

<p>They want more freedom. </p>

<p>They might want to start a consulting business, or go freelance, or build an agency - and they have ALL the skills they need - but they’re scared shitless of giving up that paycheck and benefits.</p>

<p>And I’m in a unique position to help - because I’ve done it.</p>

<p>So we finish up breakfast, and we go to work - Alice on homework I give her, me on an idea that would change my whole business.</p>

<p>I think about what I wish I’d known back when I was trapped in corporate and dying to get out. </p>

<p>I think about what I wish I’d known earlier on in my business journey - the strategies and little hacks that had allowed me to drastically change my life.</p>

<p>I think about what I would do if I wanted to start a business and make money FAST because I NEEDED to quit my soul-sucking job. </p>

<p>I sit down and write the outline for what would later become my ebook, <a href="https://katebagoy.com/ebook">Secrets of a Six-Figure Freelancer</a>.</p>

<p>Then I write and write and write, and wrote the entire book in a day. </p>

<p>And then I had the idea to make it an online program. </p>

<p>So, within a month, I created a sales page and reached out to everyone in my network who might be interested. </p>

<p>Every freelancer I knew, everyone who had mentioned wanting to start a business, everyone I knew on <a href="http://www.remoteyear.com/general-application?referee=5132575">Remote Year</a>, everyone I was connected with on LinkedIn…</p>

<p>I invited them to enroll, and I asked people to share. </p>

<p>And I somehow got 30 people to sign up! </p>

<p>So, in the early months of 2019, in my rented Airbnb room in the suburbs of Melbourne, Australia, I used my 4-year-old laptop to create a course that would change my life - and thousands of others. </p>

<p>I had no idea at the time what this would become.</p>

<p>This little idea I’d had at a cafe in Bali has led to a totally different business model (I was coaching startup clients at the time) and took me from consultant to coach, author, course creator, and entrepreneur.</p>

<p>That single idea - and some fast action - has led to a lot more freedom and fulfillment.</p>

<p><strong><em>Because a plan doesn’t need to be a big, complicated thing.</em></strong></p>

<p>All I knew was that I had a desire to help people skip the struggle that I experienced when I started my business; I didn’t know what that looked like or how I’d do it - I simply took the next logical step.</p>

<p>Two years later, we’ve made some enhancements, and more than 1500 people have gone through the Six Figure Framework™.</p>

<p>And I know we’re onto something here because I keep seeing results like these: </p>

<p><img src="images/Belema-1024x332.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="images/dan-san-1024x378.png" alt="Dan San Sales Strategist Testimonial" /></p>

<p><strong>The program works because my clients don’t waste time chasing trends, getting overwhelmed by free advice, or focusing on the number of likes or follows they get.</strong></p>

<p>They get real, strategic, PROVEN, timeless business strategy from an MBA with 10 years of experience in branding, marketing, and starting businesses.</p>

<ul>
  <li>They learn to <strong>simplify</strong>, prioritize, and stop trying to do everything.</li>
  <li>They learn to <strong>build a brand</strong> instead of hunting for gigs. </li>
  <li>They learn to <strong>get focused</strong> on the clients they want and how they can serve them best.</li>
  <li>They learn to <strong>be consistent</strong> in their marketing, messaging, and promotions to attract more leads.</li>
  <li>They learn to <strong>have sales conversations</strong> without feeling like a “salesman.”</li>
  <li>They learn to <strong>price based on value</strong> instead of time spent.</li>
</ul>

<p>And probably most importantly, they get mindset training for becoming resilient, thinking like a business owner, and shifting their beliefs around money.</p>

<p><strong>They create confidence, stop second-guessing themselves, and start taking action.</strong></p>

<p>Every.Single.Day.</p>

<p>I’m SO proud of this program. </p>

<p>So, starting in 2021, I’ll be going all-in on Six Figure Freelancers &amp; exiting the one-on-one coaching business*.</p>

<p>We’ll be pivoting to a membership model, re-doing all the videos, and adding monthly training, mastermind calls, and more.</p>

<p><strong>But in the meantime, if you’d like to lock in lifetime access to the current program, I’ve opened up enrollment.</strong> </p>

<p>You’ll get the same step-by-step strategies my private and group coaching clients have used to land $5,000 &amp; $10,000 (or even $80,000!) client contracts in their first 6-months in business.</p>

<p>And you can get started today for just a couple hundred bucks. :)</p>

<p>*I’ll still be offering private sessions, but only as an upgrade to active members of Six-Figure Freelancers. If you’ve wanted to work with me in a private business coaching program, NOW is the time to <a href="/work-with-me">apply</a> - these programs will be discontinued to the public in 2022.</p>
