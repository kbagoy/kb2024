    "title": "Three benefits of studying business",
    "body": "2023/10/10 - Studying business may sound intimidating, but the skills that you’ll develop along the way can be life-changing. A business course will teach you things that give you massive advantages as you navigate your way through your professional life in the years to come.   As such an integral part of society, businesses are seeking innovative and knowledgeable individuals to help them stay on the cutting edge of this fast-paced industry – and they’re willing to pay well for it, too. To help you decide if a business course is right for you, let’s explore three key benefits of studying business. Transferable skills: As you progress through a business course or degree, you’ll develop many high-value skills that are in high demand worldwide. The practical side of learning business management will teach you how to skillfully manage finances, and you’ll develop excellent numeracy skills, learn marketing and budgeting strategies, and gain strong decision-making skills. In addition, you’ll grow your soft skills, and likely end up with excellent communication, negotiation and presentation abilities. All of these skills are highly valued and transferable to any industry, so even if you don’t pursue a career in business after your course, you’ll walk into any other job at a much higher level. This can open up career opportunities across many sectors and industries. Good financial prospects: As we’ve touched on, having a keen set of highly valued skills will put you in good stead for taking home a decent paycheck in any industry. But working in the business sector typically returns better financial rewards than other sectors for your time and efforts.    If living a lavish lifestyle and enjoying a premium work-life balance are high on your priority list, then a business degree may be the best option for you. Also, a business degree will enable you to job-hunt worldwide, as businesses globally are constantly seeking fresh expertise and knowledge. Opportunity to specialize: During a business course you’ll gain a broad understanding of how a business is built, how it operates and what keeps it in the green. You can then choose to specialize in a specific area to take your expertise to the next level, which is particularly important for anyone looking to start up their own company. On a business degree, there are lots of different modules that could support you in setting up and managing your own business. From understanding management procedures and policies to developing vital interview skills, research processes and operation tactics, learning these essential business skills will open up global possibilities. Pave the way to being your own boss: For those with hopes of financial freedom and being your own boss, studying a business course is a great place to start. If you fancy yourself as an entrepreneur, gaining inside knowledge of the industry is sure to make starting your own business much easier and increase your chances of being successful. Plus, with the hands-on approach of many business courses, you’re sure to build a network of business-minded people who can help springboard you into making your career dreams a reality.

    "title": "Three AI tools for freelancers, that'll help you work smarter",
    "body": "2023/09/28 - AI is revolutionising the world of business. Industries of all different descriptions are capitalising on the latest advancements that are helping to boost productivity and efficiency in so many different ways. But as a freelancer, it’s unlikely that you’ll receive any kind of formal training with these tools, so it can be difficult to know what AI can do for you and just how to optimise your use of it. In this guide, we explore three ways in which you can leverage artificial intelligence to help you optimise your time and streamline your workflow as a freelancer. Automating repetitive tasks: As a freelancer, you’ll be all too familiar with those time-sapping repetitive tasks that take your attention away from the crux of your professional duties. Unfortunately, these simple yet monotonous chores are often unavoidable aspects of being a freelancer, from organising invoices each month to managing your emails. With the help of AI technology, you have the ability to automate some of these tasks that need doing on a regular basis, freeing up more of your time to focus on your primary output. For example, when it comes to invoices, AI can provide you with smart templates that can track your expenses, while also linking to time tracking tools to ensure you’re charging for your time accurately. In addition, some tools can help you to manage your inbox by automatically filtering out unhelpful emails, while also having the capacity to create content and suggest subject lines when writing your own. Creative inspiration: Whether you’re a copywriter, graphic designer or any other kind of creative freelancer, running out of ideas can be a major barrier to productivity. With the ability to analyse data and patterns, AI can enhance problem-solving capabilities by helping freelancers identify new and creative solutions that they might not be able to see themselves. In addition, certain tools can be used to generate ideas for blogs, designs or just about any other kind of creative digital outlet. By making the most of AI, you too will be able to unlock your full creative potential, even on the days where imagination is harder to come by. Time management: When it comes to time management, it can be most effective to combine human influence with the use of AI to ensure you’re optimising your time as best you can. For example, you may already utilise the services of a call handler or virtual assistant so you never miss out on an opportunity for work. But alongside this human element, you could consider using planning and scheduling tools that can automatically accept or divert calls/messages depending on whether or not the correspondence is during your working hours. You can integrate smart AI technologies into your digital calendar to help you prioritise your time effectively and automatically reschedule any conflicts to streamline your workflow and maximise your opportunity for work. Get a headstart with AI: No matter which industry you specialise in, it’s clear that AI could have a part to play in helping you to maximise your potential and income as a freelancer. Test out some of these tools for yourself and see how you could streamline your workflow. Cover photo by Windows on Unsplash "

    "title": "UI vs UX: Are They The Same Or Different, And What Is Their Impact On A Website?",
    "body": "2023/08/03 - The phrases ‘User Interface’ (UI) and ‘User Experience’ (UX) are frequently used in tech-related settings. What does a UX or UI design mean, and what is its impact on your web app or website? When using a website, app, or electronic device, you interact with screens, buttons, toggles, icons, and other visual elements, referred to as user interfaces (UI). UX describes your overall experience using a product, including your feelings during that experience. Although UI can undoubtedly influence UX, the two are separate. In this blog, we will examine the similarities and differences between UI and UX and their role in making a digital product worth its price. So, without further ado, let us get into the details. What is UX Design?: The user’s experience when interacting with a product or service is called the user experience (UX). UX design is a process that involves many various aspects of product development, such as branding, usability, function, and design, to create goods or services that offer meaningful user experiences. Consider the entire procedure or journey a user goes through while interacting with a product or service as one method to approach user experience design. Whether through blogs, advertisements, or another method, how is the service or product introduced to the user? In what ways does the user interact with the brand? After the interaction, how does the user feel? Critical factors in UX design include all of these and more inquiries. The main objective of a UX designer is for every user to interact positively with a good or service but there are many UX design challenges  faced by designers and how they can solve them to deliver good user experience. The user should feel satisfied with the engagement, whether it gives pleasure, a solution to an issue, or assistance in locating important information. What is UI Design?: Contrarily, UI design relates to the actual user interfaces that users interact with. Interactive elements such as sliders, text, photos, buttons, or widgets are used in the UI designs. UI designers ensure that each visual component, transition, and animation used in a product or service lays the groundwork for a smooth, satisfying experience. Key Differences Between UI and UX Design: Although UX and UI reflect different aspects of a product’s or service’s design, UI and UX sometimes must be clarified since they both collaborate closely. The two roles share some significant distinctions to consider. Some of their most prominent differences include: 1. Look versus Feel: Product development involves both UI and UX design, which have different but connected functions. A product’s appearance, namely the interactive and visual features that enhance the user experience, is a component of UI design. On the other hand, UX design is concerned with the overall aesthetics of a product or service and the elements that will help consumers have a valuable, pertinent experience. 2. Prototyping versus Design: Although they work on the same project, UX and UI designers have different roles and goals. UX designers usually build wireframes and test prototypes that form the basis of a website’s or service’s user flow. While UI designers create products and designs that stimulate user engagement. 3. In-depth versus High-level: The level of detail that goes into each designer’s work is another distinction between UI and UX designers. UI designers work on individual pages, buttons, and interactions to ensure their functionality and polish. UX designers ensure that the overall user flow of a website, service, or app is wholly realized and consistent by taking a higher-level perspective on a product or service. What is the Connection Between UI and UX?: The UI designer would develop the steering wheel, dashboard, and any controls in the driver’s seat if we were to simulate the app development process as creating a car. The UX designer would also ensure that the customer has a beautiful and seamless driving experience from beginning to end. As you can see from that illustration, the UX aspect considers all product or service elements, not just the digital assets. Let us take a look at a running shoe-selling app. The moment you click it, the software looks fantastic. The animation and vibrant colors are abundant, and the buttons resemble tiny sneakers. Great! What a lovely user interface! However, the shopping cart is useless; it cannot calculate shipping costs or sales taxes; the website must send out confirmations of purchases or shipment estimates; and the item takes an eternity to arrive. That user experience could be better. Therefore, even if you have the most appealing and engaging landing page, it will only matter if your website functions correctly. On the other hand, you might have a better product with a quick shipment, simple access to customer care, and frequently asked questions. However, the user is still forced to endure poor visuals and annoying sound effects. That won’t help you attract clients. Combining UI and UX Designs: The Process: The entire process of designing a site or application for usability involves UX and UI, even if their roles differ. Together, these fields of work contribute in a complimentary way to an enjoyable, straightforward user experience. A website or application’s UI design (i. e. , the technical, aesthetically pleasing framework) serves as the foundation for the UX elements, such as the messaging and feel that clients experience. As a result, the total product or service benefits, and users are left with a lasting impression. Each professional’s efforts inform those of its counterpart. Why is it Crucial to Understand Both UX and UI?: The complementary functions that UI and UX design play in web development make them naturally related. Professionals in either subject can contribute to a more transparent, integrated design process that results in a better, more usable final product by having a working knowledge of both concepts. Those who want to boost their employment prospects in various design-based positions can also benefit from such versatility. Mainly, there is a huge demand for UX design expertise worldwide. The UX Design Institute reported that in 2021, 70% of managers expanded their design teams. Those wishing to take advantage of this increasing need can benefit from having a solid understanding of both UI and UX design. Impact of UI and UX on a Website: Layout, images, and user interactions are all tailored to the user’s needs and preferences when a website is designed with a user-centered approach. Here is where UI and UX are functional. By putting the user first, websites may offer an intuitive and seamless experience, making it easier for visitors to find the information they need, complete their jobs, and reach their objectives quickly. This user-centered method creates a positive perception of the brand, raises general user satisfaction, and encourages repurchasing. Excellent UI and UX design significantly impact user engagement and retention rates. A visually appealing and well-organized user interface draws users in, enticing them to explore and stay on the website longer. Users are encouraged to return and stick with the site because of its streamlined and straightforward user interface. The effectiveness of the UI and UX design in interacting with users and fulfilling their expectations will ultimately determine the long-term viability of the website. This enhances user retention, lowers bounce rates, and increases user engagement. Conclusion: The UI and UX of a website have a significant impact on its usability. Using a user-centered design strategy, websites may build smooth, intuitive experiences that appeal to users’ wants and preferences. A thoughtful UX design coupled with an aesthetically pleasing UI encourages user retention and boosts user engagement. UI and UX-focused websites foster long-term user loyalty and favorable brand perceptions. Ultimately, investing in UI and UX design is necessary to produce user-centered websites that leave a lasting impression on visitors, improve engagement, and guarantee the website’s ongoing success in the fiercely competitive digital market.

    "title": "Get Your Creative Business on the Map",
    "body": "2023/07/06 - As a creative professional, obviously you want to get your work out there. Often, though, that’s easier said than done. The key to success is having a plan and taking the necessary steps to ensure that your work is visible and accessible. So here are some tips on how creators just like you can get their work on the map. Preparing Your Portfolio: Having an impressive portfolio is essential for any creative professional looking to get their work noticed. Make sure that your portfolio includes your best work and showcases the range of skills that you possess. If possible, include images or videos of previous projects so potential employers can get an idea of what you can do before even meeting you. Another great way to show off your skills is by using 3D texture painting to include eye-catching images. In fact, this could help your work get noticed and generate more buzz around your business. These kinds of images are also great for sharing via social media or adding to your own personal website, further expanding your potential customer base.   Writing a Business Plan: When creating a business plan, it’s important to be thorough and detail-oriented. Include information about yourself and what services and products you offer, how much money you need for start-up costs, and where potential customers may come from. Having a well-crafted business plan will give investors confidence when considering investing in your creativity. Locating Investors: Speaking of investors, you need to find investors who are interested in what you have to offer to get your work out there. Research potential investors and reach out with a detailed proposal outlining why they should invest in you. Make sure to include relevant information such as past projects, awards, or any other accolades that will help prove your worthiness as an investment, as well as show off your portfolio. Showcasing Your Work: Getting your work noticed doesn’t have to be expensive or time-consuming. Look for opportunities like art shows or gallery openings to display your work without spending too much money on advertising or marketing campaigns. Put your work out there in local newspapers, magazines, or websites, and remember to network with other creatives. Additionally, if you’re a web designer or graphic designer, take advantage of online platforms to showcase your work. Building a Network: The creative industry is all about networking, so it’s important to build relationships with other creatives to get your work noticed. Attending events is crucial. Additionally, many cities offer free spaces for creatives, such as libraries or parks where artwork can be displayed publicly, so take advantage of these resources, too. If you are a creative person looking to connect with others in the field, designing business cards can be an invaluable tool when it comes to networking. It is a great way to share contact information and make sure people remember who you are. Additionally, making sure your card accurately conveys not just your contact details but also gives the recipient insight into who you are, what values you bring to the table, and what services you offer can help build strong relationships that lead to meaningful collaborations. Registering Your Business: Registering as an LLC or Limited Liability Company provides protection against personal liability should anything happen as you conduct business activities. It also gives you more credibility, which could help attract more clients and investors, as they know that they’re dealing with someone who has taken the extra step of registering their business legally and, therefore, takes their venture seriously. If you decide to work from home, it’s a good idea to set aside a designed workspace or office. If doing so requires some renovation – like converting a garage, finishing a basement, or expanding a smaller room to give you more space and natural light – make sure you save those receipts, since certain home improvements have the added benefit of raising your home’s value. By following the above tips, creators can take their first steps toward getting their work out there and into the public eye as a legitimate business – all without breaking the bank or wasting too much time trying to figure things out on their own. Taking advantage of available resources, creating quality business cards, and registering as an LLC are just some ways you can make sure your talents are seen by potential clients and investors.   Image via Pexels "

    "title": "How to Write Compelling Email Copy that Converts",
    "body": "2023/06/07 - In 2022 alone, there were a total of 333. 2 billion emails sent out and received globally. Sounds outrageously high? That is now the reality in our increasingly digitalized world. With that huge amount of emails that people receive, how do you make sure that your email actually gets read and seen? The answer is to write a great and captivating email copy that can grab your audience’s eye.   This is why we wrote this guide for you on how to write your emails to make them pop, and make sure it doesn’t get buried under all the other emails in your audience’s inbox. Read on to find out more! 1. Tips on how to write compelling email copy: After building your email list and looking for an email automation tool to use, you are now at the hardest part of email marketing — creating the email itself. It’s not an exaggeration to say that your email’s success will greatly depend on its copy. It’s what determines if people will click on your email in the first place.   Here are some tips to keep in mind: 2. Write conversationally: We are in a digital era where social media is king. Because of this, brands and businesses feel more at reach than ever before. People view them now as friends or equals, instead of a higher authority. Which is why if you want your emails to convert, you need to write more conversationally and casually. No one wants to read an email full of corporate jargon. If you address your audience like a friend, they’ll more likely read your emails.   So how do you write conversationally? First, stick to plain language. Avoid jargon and overly-flowery words. Second, write shorter sentences. When you text your friends, you don’t really text them in full paragraphs, right? And speaking of your friends, just get into that mindset when you’re writing your emails. Try to use a more informal and relaxed language in your emails, just like how you would when you’re having a conversation with them. You can even add humor to your emails, so long as you still remain professional.   Some examples: change “Greetings” to “Hey there”, change “Tickets are available for purchase now” to “Save your spot now!”, change “Our product is rated to be a high-quality product, according to these reviews we gathered” to “Not to brag, but our product is pretty awesome. Check out these reviews!” See? Some simple changes can change up the vibe of your messages.   3. Make them personalized: Sending personalized emails is also important. While everyone knows that brands send emails in bulk, your audience still wants to feel special. After all, no one wants to read emails that feel like it was just sent to the void, that it doesn’t matter who reads it. A little VIP treatment might just be the boost you need. One of the easiest ways to do this is to address your audience by their first name. According to studies, 29% of people are more likely to open emails if their name is used. With the advancements of email marketing tools, it’s now easy to get your subscriber’s name, so there’s no excuse to not do this.   Another is to segment your emails. With email marketing tools, you can send specific emails based on different categories or criteria. This could be based on their location, gender, browsing data, actions they’ve taken on your website, etc. This means your audience can receive emails that are personalized to them or their interests, so it’s more likely that they’ll be more engaged with your messages. For example, your audience has added running shoes to his cart on your website. You can set a reminder email for him that he hasn’t checked-out the item yet. Or perhaps send him a “We think you might like this…” email, where you recommend him a track pants or gym bag to go along with his running shoes. Aside from sending well-timed messages, data can also be used to personalize the language in your emails.   Based on the data you’ve gathered, you can adjust your email’s language to one that your target audience will respond more to. For example, instead of just sending out a promotional email like “We have a new Productivity Book available in our store”, you can switch it to “We think this book can help you achieve your goals, so we set aside a copy for you. Get it here!”. The second one is definitely more personal and inviting, right?  4. Have great subject lines: Ah, subject lines. It’s truly the make or break part of emails, as most people don’t even view your message if you don’t get their attention from the start. You don’t want to waste your awesome email by having a bland subject line that people will just scroll over.   So how do you write a good one? First, keep it short and sweet. Use no more than 9 words or 60 characters. Second, make it clear from the subject what the email is about. While a little mystery might be good from time to time, generally, people want to know what the email is about before they click on it. For example, if their subscription is expiring, send them a subject line like “Hey [name], time to renew your subscription” instead of something vague like “Changes are needed in your account”. Third, use action-oriented words. This makes your email feel more exciting and adds a sense of urgency to it. Fourth, make it as compelling as possible. Pose interesting questions, or tell them a very powerful benefit they can get from your email. For example, “Are you making these 5 new baker mistakes?”, or “Here’s a tip to increase your sales by 60%” 5. Add emojis: Speaking of subject lines, another way to make it more engaging is to add emojis. According to a study by Experian, 56% of businesses have seen an increase in open rates when they’ve used emojis. So why not try to add some in your emails too? Some things to keep in mind:  Don’t overuse it. Use one or two at most in your subject lines.  Don’t use it in every single subject line of yours. Your audience will get tired of it fast! Only use it when it makes sense. If you are a formal B2B business, your audience probably won’t appreciate emojis. But if you are catered to a younger Gen-Z audience, then use them by all means.   Test out different ones. Some emojis might work better than others. Experiment to see what works best for you.  The most commonly used emoji is the red heart. You can use the same one to fit in with others, or you try less used emojis to stand out.  6. Use marketing psychology: Employing various marketing psychology tactics can also help in making your email more compelling. Some examples are FOMO and using social proof.   FOMO, or the Fear Of Missing Out, is one of the biggest tactics to invoke a sense of urgency. Using lines like “Limited Time Only”, “Stock is running out!”, “All your friends are already using this…” can make your products look more in-demand, and can also cause people to click on your email since they want to get the deals while it’s still available. Implying that lots of people are already using the product is also effective, since people always want to be “in the know” and don’t want to miss out on the trends.   Social proof, on the other hand, is the use of customer reviews as proof that your product is well-liked. You can add snippets of 5 star customer reviews on your email body, or mention it in your subject line. This is effective because people tend to trust reviews more than they trust promotional content from a brand. 7. Don’t forget your visuals: While the copy and text is important, having great visuals is also crucial. Make sure to use appealing and high-quality images, whether you use photography or graphic art on your emails. Don’t forget your branding - stick to your brand’s color scheme and typography, and always add your logo. If you don’t have a logo yet, check out logo maker tools online to get started. Make sure to stick to a clean and easily readable layout. Your text should be aligned in the center. See if there is good contrast between the background color and your text. Also, check if your emails are mobile-friendly.   8. Wrapping Up: Your email copy plays a huge part in the success of your email marketing campaigns. Carefully consider the language and tone of your emails, send them to the correct person at the right time, match it with eye-catching visuals, and make sure to always proofread.   With our tips, you’ll be improving your email’s conversion rate for sure.   Author’s Bio: Janella Malapad - Janella is an outreach specialist at DesignCrowd, your go-to online creative hub for logo design, website design contests, and an array of imaginative graphic design possibilities.

    "title": "Running A Business & Having a Life",
    "body": "2023/05/29 - Running a business brings many challenges, and so does running a household. While the two aren’t mutually exclusive, keeping all aspects of your life operating smoothly requires some organization and planning. Todaywe have some tips to help you manage the many facets of your life. Set priorities and boundaries It’s important to establish what your priorities are, so make a list of them. Determine what is essential, what would be nice, and what can be put aside, at least for now. Once you are clear on the things that are most important, develop a schedule for attending to them. You may not have to do every single thing yourself–accepting help is a strength. You’ll need to set boundaries to make sure your time and energy are going to the things that are most important to you. You may need to put exercise or time with friends on your calendar to prevent brushing them aside. Setting and sticking with regular work hours can be very helpful. Learning to say no is important in business as well as social and home life. Delegate Although many entrepreneurs like being hands-on with all aspects of the business, nobody can truly do it all. It’s important to distinguish the things that must be done by you, from the things that can be delegated. You may find that you can hire freelancers to take on certain tasks at your business, particularly during the busier seasons. You might use a virtual assistant at work to automate emails to customers, social media postings, and other routine tasks. Sometimes hiring a professional for specific endeavors can save you a lot of time and money.   For instance, if you have decided to make your business a limited liability company (LLC), which has tax benefits as well as protects your assets, you could hire an attorney to do the legwork. Since each state has different regulations for LLCs, you might want to work with an online formation service that’s already familiar with the specific regulations and can get you started in minutes. Delegate at home, too You may also find it helpful to delegate some of the responsibilities associated with your home life. One can often find freelancers to do tasks including cleaning, pet care, child care, and running errands. Don’t overlook the value of asking other household members to help, too. Kids and teens can help fold and put away laundry, take out the trash, and help with simple tasks like sweeping and loading the dishwasher. If you lack time to go to the gym, you might benefit from an online exercise coach or class. Manage your documents Your business needs a good document management system. At some point, most businesses will need to share documents with staff, suppliers, or clients. In many instances, PDFs are the preferred format for such documents. Although some work may have been created as image files, the best solution is to use this free tool to convert them to PDFs, saving you lots of time and hassle.   Although nobody would claim that running a business and running a household simultaneously is easy, it can be done with adequate help. It’s important to acknowledge your own limitations and honor them rather than overextending yourself and getting burned out. Set your priorities, and schedule them. Be sure to include time with your family, friends, pets, and hobbies, as well as exercise and adequate sleep if these are important to you. Delegate, ask for help, and learn to say no to things that don’t support your goals and priorities. Remember to schedule some slow time or rest time, too–none of us can operate at full speed indefinitely.

Now, with TaylorandNoel. com, he’s sharing his best practices with other freelancers, in hopes they can do the same. "

    "title": "Legal Issues Every Freelancer Should Know About",
    "body": "2023/04/12 - Freelancers may work as subcontractors, independent contractors, or gig workers under the term “freelancer. ” Under the law, freelancers are treated as business owners rather than employees. Unlike other workers, you are not subject to the laws governing employment. You operate like a small business; generally, the law treats you that way. You can take on multiple clients without worrying about employee benefits. If you’re running a freelance business, it’s crucial to understand how the law affects your ability to operate legally. You must understand what the law is and how it affects your freelancing. This will help ensure that you don’t encounter any problems with tax or contract issues that could cause trouble for your freelancing. Legal Issues to Consider for Every Freelancer: You may not have the resources of a larger company to handle legal matters, but it’s important to know the basics of what every freelancer should know about legal issues. Here are some of the most important things every freelancer should know about legal issues and what they mean for your business: Form an LLC: Although you can run your freelance business as a sole proprietorship, it is usually better to form a limited liability company with one member. Most importantly, a limited liability company reduces the risk of business debts being paid with personal assets. Depending on your circumstances, the S-Corp tax election may reduce your taxes. LLCs are also better business structures for freelancers. An LLC lets you add owners, get an EIN, open a business bank account, and better track business expenses. Finally, potential customers view LLCs as more credible. Get help from a business lawyer if you need help forming an LLC. As a freelancer, you may think that legal issues are only for big businesses, but that’s not true. Even freelancers need to know about legal matters — especially if they want to stay in business. Business lawyers are experts in their field, and they can quickly help you form an LLC. They can also advise what steps to take after starting your company. Pay Taxes: Freelancers are responsible for fulfilling their tax responsibilities. This indicates that the federal government, state governments, and local governments will look to you to pay your income taxes, taxes for social security and Medicare, taxes for local governments, and other taxes. Setting aside thirty percent of your net income for taxes is generally recommended. You should pay estimated taxes quarterly and prepare to make additional payments at tax time if you owe more than you paid last year. The most effective way to handle this administrative work is to talk to an accountant. Contracts and Agreements: When you start working for clients in any capacity, you must have some kind of contract or agreement between yourself and them. This could be anything from an invoice for work to a non-disclosure agreement (NDA).   A good contract will protect both parties from misunderstandings or disagreements in the future; it should clearly state what each party expects from the other party, how payments are made and when they are due, what happens if one party fails to do what they agreed upon, etc. Contracts with Subcontractors: Make sure all your subcontractors have written contracts. In hiring a subcontractor, you will make a contract with a format similar to the agreements you make with clients, but they are undoubtedly written differently. Intellectual property provisions should be included in the subcontractor agreement template you use. Make sure your template states that you own the work product created by the subcontractor (and all associated IP). Otherwise, the subcontractor may claim ownership of all that work. You won’t be able to pass ownership on to your clients. Insurance: You must be insured. If you live in a state with individual mandates for residents, you must have health insurance or pay the penalty. If you’re an independent contractor and don’t have an employer-sponsored plan, you can buy insurance on your own through the exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Otherwise, you can purchase individual coverage from an insurer participating in the ACA’s small business exchange or through Healthcare. gov. Termination Rights: When freelancers work for clients or other businesses, they often sign contracts that specify the contract’s duration, rights to terminate the contract early, and penalties if the contract is terminated by one party, not the other. If you agree with someone paying you for your services, you must know what your rights are in case anything goes wrong. Clarify the terms and ensure that you and the clients are on the same page regarding the specifics. If there are disagreements later, the contract will serve as a point of reference for both of you. Also, the contract should serve as a warning sign. You should not engage in commercial transactions with a customer unwilling to sign a contract or attempting to negotiate terms that heavily favor their requirements. Conclusion: Freelancing is an excellent way to earn money on your own schedule. You get to set your own hours and pick and choose projects that interest you. However, it can also be a very challenging lifestyle without the right protections. As a freelancer, the law will only protect you if you take the necessary steps to protect yourself in the first place. To avoid being on the losing end of a legal dispute, do some research and speak with a lawyer about potential issues. "

    "body": "2023/03/26 - Writing is a skill that doesn’t come easy to everyone, but if it’s something you do well and enjoy then you should consider potential writing careers.   Working as a freelance writer is a great way to earn some extra money and improve your craft. It’s a very flexible option with plenty of opportunities.   Increase Your Income Ceiling : Your income ceiling is a metaphorical barrier you hit when you are no longer able to earn more money based on the work you’re doing. For example, if you’re a photographer you can only handle so many clients at a time. In order to make more money, you either need to raise your prices or hire more help so you can take on more clients.   With freelancing, you get to increase how much you’re able to earn. You have more control over the work you’re able to do and you can take on as many clients as you can. If you have another job, then working as a freelancer only adds to the income you’re making.   Start Your Own Retirement Plan : Everyone should begin saving for retirement as early as they can. This gives you more time to save up for retirement. As a freelancer, you have a lot of options when it comes to starting a retirement account. You get to choose the plan that works best for you.   SEP-IRAs are ideal choices for self-employed people due to their simplicity. They have high contribution limits, don’t require contributions each year, and are extremely flexible. Other plan options include traditional and Roth IRA plans, Solo 401(k) accounts, and a simple IRA. More Flexibility : One of the main benefits of being a freelance writer is you have more control over your career and what work you do. You get to choose what projects you work on. You choose where you work from. You’re in control of how much you work at a time. You aren’t beholden to anyone else’s schedule (aside from the needs of your clients).  As a freelancer, it’s easier to have a work-life balance and you don’t need to feel overwhelmed by work. Everything is on your terms.   If writing is something you want to pursue, then you should look into freelance work. You can improve your writing skills, explore new kinds of writing, and earn some extra money. It’s worth it to learn more about being a freelance writer.   Did you enjoy reading this article?

    "title": "The Benefits of Working as a Freelancer",
    "body": "2023/02/15 - Freelance work has become more popular, but for many people, it can still be an unfamiliar idea. While there are a lot of upsides to working as a normal employee, there are some benefits that come from being a freelancer that you aren’t going to find in a normal job that can make up for some of the stress that comes from working freelance. Create Your Own Schedule: As a freelancer, you are answerable only to yourself and the deadlines that you set when scheduling your projects with your clients. This allows you to set your own schedule and work at whatever time works best for you. Some people find they are more productive at different times of day, so experiment with different schedules to see what works best for you.   You can also take a break if you need to relax or run errands, without worrying that your boss will notice that you aren’t at work. It is important to actually set aside time to work though. If you don’t, you run the risk of putting it off until the last minute and either missing deadlines or rushing the job. Reduce Your Taxes: As a self-employed freelancer, you are required to file taxes as a business owner in order to stay on the right side of the IRS. However, there are things that you can do to reduce the amount of taxes that you have to pay. Keep track of what you are paying for and using for your business. For instance, if you have to drive to meet with clients, you can deduct some of those costs as a business expense.   You can also invest some of your income in your own retirement accounts. A SEP-IRA lets you make tax-deductible contributions of 20% of your net income. Because of the deductions you are able to make, you are likely to end up paying fewer taxes than a normal employee who makes the same gross amount as you. Enjoy Your Work: One of the biggest struggles that people have with work is figuring out how to enjoy what they are spending their time doing. However, if you are freelancing, that means you get to choose what you are doing, which allows you to turn your passions into your career. This doesn’t mean it is easy by any stretch of the imagination, but it does mean that you are unlikely to hate your job or feel uninspired. This is one of the biggest benefits of working freelance. Combined with the ability to set your own schedule, you can easily find a way to live a life that you love. In addition to these benefits, working as a freelancer opens up your earning potential to anything you are willing to work for. It takes hard work and a lot of dedication, but there is always a way to be successful at what you love doing. Ready to start your consulting business? Grab my book to get started today. "

    "body": "2022/12/29 - Your business deserves only the very best. You should also be aware of the common pitfalls for new startups. One of the best things to know is the underutilized tools that many small business owners don’t even realize are available. If you educate yourself, you might get a leg up in a market that can be quite difficult. Outsourcing Agencies: Outsourcing is the practice of moving certain parts of your business to other contractors or companies who will complete the tasks for you. This can prove very useful for elements of running a business that you don’t feel are very relevant to what your company does.   It also is helpful to have seasoned professionals deal with something that you and your employees likely don’t have experience with. A few common examples are the outsourcing of accounting, taxes, and human resources. Research outsourcing agencies that you can utilize for the best results that will benefit the weaknesses of your specific business. Networking Sites: The modern internet has radically changed how the career industry functions. Many people still will ask for paper resumes, for example–but many others will include a digital aspect in their hiring process. Networking sites like LinkedIn and Handshake are becoming more and more common. About 23% of employers say social media led them to hire a candidate.   Social media is even used by employers to double-check the nature of their candidates. If you want to stay on top of the shifting trends in the current job market, it’s a good idea to get a strong social media presence.   Proper Technology Integration: The internet isn’t the only thing that has evolved. Along with social media usage for companies (which can include everything from hiring to branding), more technology is being incorporated into the customer experience. Sometimes it might be for practical reasons, and other times it might simply be for aesthetic purposes, but it always enhances your business when used appropriately. For example, people expect restaurants and other food service locations to be accessible through delivery applications like UberEats or DoorDash. Make sure to understand what the technical standards currently are for your industry. Keep that in mind when creating your business budget. Running a business is hard no matter what–even if you had all the funding you could possibly need. It’s up to you to use the opportunities you have to build the best company possible. Always be researching and updating your understanding of the industry’s trends.   Ready to start your consulting business? Grab my book to get started today. "

    "body": "2022/12/09 - Finding ways to control costs is an important task for any business, no matter how big or small it is. That said, small businesses need to stay on top of their business expenses since they often have less wiggle room to work with before those costs start to eat into their profits too much. One way small businesses can reduce their expenses is to use strategies that reduce their taxes. Take Deductions: Tax deductions are a great way to reduce your taxable income. Tax deductions are designed to allow you to keep more money for your business. That gives you a better chance to grow, maximize your profits, and reinvest in your business in all sorts of ways.   There are many business expenses you can deduct from the money your business brings in. You could deduct a portion of the cost of food and drink for business meals, work-related travel expenses and car use, business insurance, office supplies, and more. Choosing the Right Structure: Before you officially got your business up and running, you had to decide how you wanted to structure it. Common small business structures include sole proprietorships, LLCs, partnerships, corporations, and S corporations. Which structure you choose impacts how your business is taxed. For example, an S-corp helps you reduce the amount of FICA taxes you have to pay.   Structuring as a sole proprietorship allows you to deduct the cost of health insurance for yourself, your spouse, and any dependents you may have even if you don’t itemize your deductions on your return. Consider which structure will be most advantageous for your business and weigh the advantages and disadvantages of restructuring if necessary. Invest in Professional Tax Services: If you’ve ever tried doing taxes for your business on your own, you know how quickly that becomes overwhelming. Save yourself time, money, and trouble by finding a good tax professional to handle your business’s tax returns. As a professional, they’ll be experts at finding ways to reduce your tax liability. They may find ways to save that you haven’t considered before and offer insight on how to reduce your tax liability further in the future.   Paying taxes matters regardless of whether you’re paying as an individual or a business. No one should pay more than is necessary though, including businesses. Use strategies that help you reduce your tax liability so you can retain more of your money and invest it back into your business. That’s one of the best things you can do to help your business succeed. Want to start your 6-figure business? Get my top secrets here. "

    "body": "2022/12/06 - Learning how to become a smarter decision-maker is a priceless life skill to have. This skill can save you a lot of stress, trouble, and heartache in the future. Getting better and then continuing to make smarter decisions is especially important in business settings where poor decisions can cost you thousands of dollars.   Learn From Your Mistakes: You will never make smarter decisions if you don’t first acknowledge past mistakes and learn from them. Mistakes don’t mean that you will always be bad at making decisions; they just mean that you have room to improve and things to learn.   You should analyze your mistakes objectively without getting too emotional or hurt over them, which may mean waiting a while before fully analyzing a mistake. “Mistakes journals” are commonly used for standardized test preparation, but they can also be used for any type of mistake as well. When documenting your mistakes, you can record what happened, what could have gone differently, and what you learned.   Gather Data: Making good decisions depends heavily on having good data. Data gives you direction for making decisions because it allows you to predict possible outcomes. Good business decisions rely on key insights.   These insights typically include revenue analysis, sales trends, and consumer patterns. If you are not good at gathering data yourself, hire someone to help you or use data-gathering programs.   Avoid Making Reckless Decisions: Wise decisions are based on sound judgment. Typically, these decisions are thought up, analyzed, and implemented gradually. This gradual progression of decision-making leads to better thought-out choices with more positive outcomes. Being in the right mindset is crucial to avoiding reckless decisions. For example, you should not make important decisions when you are exhausted since exhaustion makes it hard to concentrate. Similarly, you should avoid making important decisions when you are particularly hungry or emotional either. These outside factors affect you physically and mentally, leading to more reckless decisions. More reckless decisions could have serious negative repercussions on your life and business.   In the business world, you need to consistently be making intelligent decisions to succeed in your market and stay relevant. Learning decision-making skills in other parts of your life can greatly improve the quality of your decision-making in terms of your business. Becoming a smarter decision-maker will only happen as you continually make decisions. Learn to take considerable risks and choose what you think is best. Then, always be willing to learn from your mistakes.   Want to start your own business? Learn more about my secret strategies. "

    "body": "2022/12/03 - Remote work can come with a lot of challenges if your company isn’t set up to facilitate this type of work. Although remote work can be very rewarding, and incentivize your employees to stay at your business, there are still some issues you need to work through. Here are a few challenges when trying to make remote work function well. Disengaged Employees: First, you might encounter employees that are easily distracted and disengaged as they’re working from a remote location. This is an understandable issue since it is much easier to take breaks and get distracted when you’re working in a home setting. However, there are some approaches that you can implement to help disengaged employees to become more productive and eager in their work.   First, you can have group meetings throughout the day to check up on projects and discuss different responsibilities. You can also have your employees track their hours. This can help them to prevent their work from dragging on throughout long hours and instead motivate them to work productively in a small chunk of time. Communicating with your employees throughout the day can also keep them engaged and motivated. Collaboration Issues: Another issue that you might run into is the lack of collaboration when everyone is working remotely. If you never schedule team meetings or facilitate company communication, you can expect that collaboration will zero out. However, if you schedule regular collaboration and brainstorming meetings, the collaboration will increase.   You can also encourage collaboration by opening easy communication methods for your employees. This can help them to talk about different challenges they’re working on. Installing cloud software can also help your employees easily share files and projects for collaboration purposes. Cloud software is what makes remote work possible for your business. Security Threats: Finally, you also might encounter some security issues as you have your employees working remotely. If they’re not using a secured, private Wi-Fi network, they might have some inconsistencies in their connection, and also run the risk of malware attacks. Instead, require that your employees have a private IP address or Wi-Fi connection to provide them with additional security. You can also make sure that all of your employees have security software installed and downloaded on their computers to prevent your valuable company information from being attacked. Security software can protect your business from online security threats and breaches that could be detrimental to your reputation and business functions.   So, if you’re trying to start up a remote team in your business, remember these tips. You might have disengaged employees, collaboration issues, or security threats, but with the right software and approaches, you can take care of these challenges. This can help your business to be more effective and your employees to be happier as you provide a great remote work environment. Did you enjoy this article?

    "body": "2022/12/01 - Different businesses are going to need different assets. Some might need commercial property. Others might simply need one or more commercial vehicles. If you need a vehicle for your business then make sure that you’re prepared with everything you need to know before you finalize the paperwork and get the vehicle. Write Off the Expenses: Every year, every single business and business owner in the United States needs to pay their taxes. If you have an expert with you who knows what they’re doing, you can usually avoid any crippling tax payments. There are many ways you can claim your taxes in order to legally minimize what you’re paying. Business expenses are one of the most important for you to know about.   Since, theoretically, every extraneous business expense subtracts from your overall profit, the more business expenses you claim, the fewer taxes you have to pay on your overall profit. Commercial vehicles are a part of this. The purchase of the vehicle itself as well as all maintenance (gas and otherwise) can be written off as a business expense. Keep Them Maintained: That being said – maintenance is still going to make you lose money. This is especially true for trucks or other more specialized vehicles that might require special gasoline or other special attention. But it will always be worth your time, money, and effort to keep them in tip-top condition. Why? Any problem, including small issues, will only grow and become more expensive with time.   Not only will they cost more, but a commercial vehicle in bad shape is a recipe for an accident and a lawsuit. There are ways you can save money during maintenance, though; keeping your car clean doesn’t always require water. Training: Some vehicles might require special training in order to use. Such notable vehicles are large vans or trucks, forklifts, tractors, semi-trucks, or other such kinds of heavy machinery. Always make sure that your employees have the proper training and/or licensing required in order to operate your commercial vehicles.   Even those who drive commercial vehicles that are regular, day-to-day cars should be carefully briefed on company policy and practice. Make sure that thorough logs are kept about maintenance and vehicle use. You can never be too careful when it comes to your company’s heavy machinery. Business vehicles are very useful. They enable you to get around town and to get the job done while simultaneously advertising your business to the locality. You do need to make sure that you have all of your bases covered–otherwise, you might encounter legal problems. Did you enjoy reading this article?

    "body": "2022/10/31 - Employees are the lifeblood of any company. How should you vet potential employees to make sure you choose the right ones? They are a huge part of what determines how successful you can be. Because of how critical they are to succeeding as a business, choosing the right employees to work for you is imperative.   Review Their Resume: One of the first steps in vetting potential employees is reviewing the resumes you receive once you’ve posted a job listing. This is your chance to see if the applicants appear to meet the minimum requirements for the job. Reviewing a resume to vet candidates means more than just looking at their employment history though. Look for relevant keywords that indicate a candidate’s understanding of the responsibilities and expectations for the position. You can look for career progression that indicates a desire to advance and improve themselves. Ask the Right Questions: Once you’ve narrowed down your list of potential employees using the submitted resumes, it’s time to move on to the interview process. Prepare for the interview by creating a list of questions to ask the candidates. Don’t write down just any questions though. You need to ask the right questions. Some questions can get you into trouble if you ask them. Questions about the candidate’s family or personal life may seem harmless, but they can end up being discriminatory. Focus on questions that help you learn more about the candidate so you can decide if they’re a good fit for the job. Verify What You’ve Learned: While the hope is that those you interview will be honest and upfront during the interview, it’s foolish to not take the chance to verify what you’ve been told. There’s no point in asking for references if you aren’t going to contact them. If you have candidates that seem promising after the interview, take time to speak to the references they’ve provided. Verify what the candidate has told you and listen to what they say about the candidate’s performance on the job. This can provide valuable insight into work ethic and personality. If you want your business to succeed, you can’t settle for just any employee. You need employees that are trainable and trustworthy, employees who will rise to the occasion and help you take your business to the next level. You need employees with the right qualifications who fit your company culture. Carefully vet potential employees so you can make the right hires for your company.

    "title": "Why You Need Cloud Storage for Your Business",
    "body": "2022/10/28 - There are a lot of reasons why you need cloud storage for your business. Many businesses choose to store their data on-premise, which can be costly and time-consuming. With cloud storage, you can access your data from anywhere in the world, making it the perfect solution for businesses with a remote workforce. Consider these three key benefits of using cloud storage for your business. Save Money and Space: When you store data on the cloud, you free up space on your computer’s hard drive. This is not only more efficient, but it can also save you money. Hard drives are becoming increasingly expensive, and if you store a lot of data, you may need to upgrade to a larger hard drive or even buy a new computer. Cloud storage is much cheaper than buying new hardware, and it’s easier to scale up or down as your needs change. In addition, cloud storage is more secure than storing data on your own computer.   If your computer crashes or is lost or stolen, your data will be safe. And if you need to share files with others, the cloud makes it easy to do so without sending large attachments by email. For all these reasons, cloud storage is an essential tool for businesses of all sizes. Organize Your Digital Assets: Any business today needs to have a plan for organizing and storing its digital assets. This is everything from product photos and videos to marketing collateral and client records. It’s important to have a system for storing and retrieving these files, and cloud storage is the best solution for most businesses. The first reason is that it’s secure. Your data is stored remotely, so even if your office is broken into or your computer is hacked, your files will be safe.   Cloud storage also makes it easy to share files with employees or clients and to collaborate on projects. And because you can access your files from anywhere, it’s easy to work on the go. Finally, digital asset management requires dedicating time and resources. By using cloud storage, you can free up your IT staff to work on other projects. All of these reasons make cloud storage the best solution for business owners who want to keep their digital assets safe and organized. Protect Digital Assets: Your business’ digital assets are important. They include your website, social media accounts, marketing materials, and any images or videos you use for your business. If these assets were to be lost or damaged, it would be difficult to replace them. Cloud storage is a great way to protect your digital assets. It provides a secure, off-site location for you to store backups of your website and other digital files. This way, if your computer crashes or your office is damaged in a natural disaster, you will still have access to your digital assets. In addition, cloud storage offers greater security than storing files on your computer’s hard drive; your files are encrypted and stored in a secure data center. This makes it much more difficult for hackers to access your files. As you can see, cloud storage is an essential tool for protecting your business’s digital assets. Cloud storage is a great way to save money and space while protecting your business’s digital assets. If you’re not already using it, consider implementing it for your business today.

    "body": "2022/10/22 - Any team will work better when the members of that team have a stronger connection. People are more productive when they have relationships and a bond. As an employer, you want to find ways to connect better with your employees so you can create a more united team and build better relationships with them. Get Their Input: What works well for one group of people doesn’t always apply to everyone. If you want to find the best ways to connect with your employees then you need to ask them. Talk with your employees and figure out what they are looking for. You can ask them how they like to receive feedback, how they’d like to connect more, and what types of interactions they respond best to. Asking for employee input can be done in many ways. You can create an anonymous survey for everyone to fill out or you can host a focus group where you have a discussion. You can also talk with employees one on one and see what their individual needs are. Hold a Culture Event: If you want to connect with people, then you all need a chance to see each other outside the workplace. Holding a culture event gives everyone the opportunity to connect and socialize without the pressure of work. People can mingle, have a good time, and form genuine friendships with each other. Hosting a good culture event all depends on the environment you create. An event space needs good lighting and design to create the right atmosphere. Keep it fun and engaging. You also want to have a plan for the evening. Provide dinner, set up some activities, or have an event to tie everything together. People will enjoy themselves more if there is a plan beyond just mingling.

    "body": "2022/10/12 - A well-run business requires efficiency, and that means completing necessary tasks quickly, effectively, and without wasting time or resources. With some complex tasks, however, reaching efficiency can be difficult, especially if you try to tackle them all yourself. It’s better if you can implement strategies to make complex tasks easier for your business. Outsource Them: Outsourcing certain tasks that require specialized knowledge makes sense in terms of both finances and production. You will save time and money if you hire contractors who can do the work in a fraction of the time that you can and with better results. Two of the most commonly outsourced complex tasks involve accounting and technology. A professional accountant can save you money and avoid potential problems by overseeing your taxes and helping you identify waste. Outsourcing tasks involving technology, such as website development or cyber security, will ensure a more professionally-done job. Rely on Software Tools: Software tools, even those as simple as a spreadsheet, can make the most time-consuming tasks easier and more efficient. Bookkeeping software can not only keep track of transactions but quickly provide you with reports that can give you useful information in running your business. Inventory management software is a necessity if you deal in sales. Do your research before deciding on which software is right for you. There are often several apps or services that will have similar features but with a slightly different focus. Keeping your software up to date helps improve overall security. Delegate Them: Good leaders learn in a hurry: when a task is complex, break it up into steps, create a timeline, and delegate. Often, owners of small businesses fall into the trap of trying to do everything themselves. Instead, learn to trust your employees and take advantage of their strengths. Using teamwork, and delegating each specific step or responsibility to a team member, can get jobs done quickly. It will also build your employees’ confidence and further develop their abilities. In the long run, they’ll feel more valued and more committed to your business. Small business owners face an enormous job, as they are almost always both the boss and an essential worker in the business. But whatever the size of your business, you shouldn’t try to do everything yourself. Relying on the right tools and the right people can free you up for making larger and more impactful decisions for your business. Want to get your business above six figures?

But staying out of trouble can be a lot easier with a few simple pointers. Here are three tips on how to stay out of trouble with the IRS and avoid any penalties or fines.  Follow these tips, and you’ll be in good shape. Meet your Tax Deadlines: Everyone knows that paying taxes is a part of being a responsible adult. But what happens if you can’t pay your taxes on time? The IRS has a variety of tools at its disposal to collect the money you owe, and they’re not afraid to use them. That’s why it’s important to make sure you meet your tax deadlines. Whether you’re filing an individual return or a business return, the IRS expects you to meet the April 15th deadline.   If you can’t pay the full amount owed, it’s better to file your return on time and pay as much as you can. The penalties for late filing are much less than the penalties for late payment. So if you’re in a tight spot, make sure you file on time and pay what you can. It may not be everything the IRS wants, but it’s better than nothing. Organize Your Finances: When it comes to staying out of trouble with the IRS, organization is key. Keeping track of your income and expenses can seem daunting, but it’s essential to maintaining a healthy financial life. One way to stay organized is to outsource your accounting. Outsourcing your accounting can be more affordable than hiring someone in-house. Additionally, it will free up your time to focus on other aspects of your business.   A professional accountant can help you keep track of your finances and ensure that you are compliant with tax laws. In addition, they can offer valuable insights into how you can improve your financial situation. By outsourcing your accounting, you can take one step toward staying out of trouble with the IRS. Save Everything: One of the best tips for avoiding trouble with the IRS is to keep meticulous records of all your financial transactions. This may seem like a tedious task, but it will be well worth it if you ever find yourself in an audit. By keeping track of all your income and expenses, you can be sure that you are accurately reporting your taxes. Additionally, saving receipts and other documentation can help you to substantiate your deductions. While it may take some extra effort to stay organized, it is far better than dealing with the hassle and stress of an audit. By following these three tips, you can stay out of trouble with the IRS and avoid any penalties or fines. Pay your taxes on time, keep good records, and be organized. If you do these things, you’ll be in good shape come tax season. So don’t wait until it’s too late. Get started today! Did you enjoy reading this article?

However, this development also comes along with increasing cybersecurity issues that can threaten the data of your business and customers. Here are a few ways to avoid cybersecurity issues for your business. Back-Up Your Data: First of all, you can avoid some cybersecurity issues by backing up your business data consistently. Make sure that you have technology like a hard drive, memory drive, or flash drive to store data for your business. Backing up your data can help you to have a secure, accurate copy of your data in case it is ever stolen, breached, altered, or corrupted. If you have employees that are regularly working with your business data and software, make sure that you show them how to back up the data so it is properly stored and secured. Use Secure Networks: Another approach that will help you to avoid cybersecurity issues for your business is to use secure internet networks. Unsecured networks or public Wi-Fi can present a number of safety risks since they are easier for people to hack into and steal data. If you use public Wi-Fi, you should also use a VPN for improved security. A VPN is an encrypted, private network that will be secure and protected to work on. It is particularly important for your business to use a VPN when you have remote workers that might be traveling and using different networks while they’re working. Use Security Features: Finally, make sure that you and all your employees are using security features to protect your business data. These security features could include anything from strong passwords to a two-step authentication process to secure payment processes. Make sure that your employees know how to create strong passwords, and don’t repeat passwords for multiple purposes. Use different multifactor authentication technologies to prevent people from easily hacking into your accounts. Secure payment processing can also protect clients’ payment information. Having this security feature in place will help to protect the data of your business, employees, and clients. So, if you’re trying to protect your company from cybersecurity threats and data breaches, make sure that you apply these ideas in your workplace. Remember to back up your data, use secure networks, and use security features. This will keep your company and client’s data safe and secure from threats. What to build a six-figure business plan?

Know What You Need to Pay: The first step in avoiding tax trouble at your small business is to know how much tax you need to pay.

Knowing this financial information throughout the year makes it all that much easier to file your taxes when the time comes.

Many kinds of software can help you keep track of your finances and file your taxes correctly and effectively. Withhold Taxes: Part of running a small business is knowing how much tax to withhold from your employees and expenses.

    "body": "2022/07/23 - As a business owner, it’s easy to become overwhelmed. You have many responsibilities on your plate and you might feel like you have to take it on all by yourself. However, your business can suffer if you’re feeling burnt out. It’s important to find ways to keep your business running and thriving even if you’re experiencing burnout. Take a Step Back: One of the first things you should do is take some time to take care of yourself. If you’re feeling burnt out, then you shouldn’t keep pushing yourself. This will only make the situation worse and it will be harder to recover. Take a step back from everything. Delegate your responsibilities to people you can trust and step away from your business for a while. Taking time to care for yourself can help you feel more refreshed and energized so you can help your business succeed. As you take time to deal with burnout, discover what specifically impacts you and how you can prevent or reduce it in the future. Outsource: It takes a lot to keep a business running and one reason you may feel burnout is simply that you’re taking on too much at once. A great solution for this is outsourcing some of your responsibilities. When you outsource, you turn over certain elements of your business to professionals. Many people will outsource their marketing or their accounting. This takes the responsibility away from you and you know that the work will be done correctly and done well. Outsourcing during a period of high growth can help you manage your business. While your business grows, you experience more responsibilities and likely more burnout. As things become busier, begin delegating tasks so you can stay on top of it. Take Time to Reflect: When experiencing burnout, you may be weighed down by mistakes or issues that have happened in the past. Focusing on negative experiences from the past can make burnout worse because you’re already feeling overwhelmed by current circumstances. Instead of obsessing over past mistakes, take time to learn from them. Reflect on the past of your business and see where you can make improvements. Take note of what you can do better next time. As you do this, define clear goals for your business. If you’re feeling burnout because you aren’t achieving anything, goals can help you have a clearer target and something to work toward. Burnout is a very real thing and it affects many people. If you feel burned out, it can negatively impact your business as a whole. Finding ways to handle your burnout can be beneficial to both you and your business. Need help to get your business off the ground? Get a step-by-step guide here! "

    "body": "2022/07/20 - Social media is an essential part of modern-day advertising and branding. The amount of time that the average individual spends online now is so significant that your use of social media is equally as important as your use of commercial property. That’s why your content on social media has got to be top-notch. Use Visuals on Posts: Your content needs to be attention-grabbing. It needs to be something that makes people pause when scrolling. Simply put, a block of text will not do that; you need visuals. That might be a photo ad, it might be a short video, but you need to have elements with color and personality that jump off the screen and grab their attention. Make sure that you go along with basic graphic design principles. Keep things simple and within a certain aesthetic. Make it recognizable. Make sure the message of the visual media is clear and (although it should be engaging) not inappropriate. You can either hire a graphic designer, or you can try to do things yourself with free programs like Canva. Find Your Voice: This one is a little bit more of a nebulous concept, but it’s important. Your company’s voice is part of your branding. It can be hard to understand a voice just from looking at a business logo – but think about commercials that you’ve seen for other brands or restaurants. They usually have a short, punchy motto that never changes. Their commercials usually have a certain tone. The aesthetic, colors, and logo of the brand fit right in with the voice and the attitude. A well-defined brand voice can help you connect with your target audience. That is what you can try and capture on social media. You can use it in visual media and with interactions with clients. Again, be careful to keep yourself professional. Interact With Potential Clients: One last important tip is that you should not simply post things. You need to interact. You should want people to see your brand, see your voice, and be compelled by the content. You can respond to comments or questions about the brand. The brand itself can ask questions. You can try to be both serious and funny at the right moments. Be cautious about overstepping boundaries and know that most people tend to be wary of brands on social media, perceiving them as inauthentic. Good content is hard to make, even for regular people who don’t have to promote a business. The key is consistency and persistence. Your brand isn’t going to be built overnight. If you prepare, innovate, and know the medium well, you’ll have great company content in no time. Need more expert advice on building your brand? Get my book here! "

    "body": "2022/07/11 - With many economists expecting inflation to get worse, many consumers are looking for ways to save money during these expensive times. To ensure you’re prepared for rising prices and a possible recession, you’re likely looking for ways you can cut costs and save some extra money. To learn new ways you can save, continue reading through these helpful tips.   5 money-saving tips to help battle inflation: While you may have your own tried and true ways of saving some extra cash, there may be other areas where you can save. Follow along to learn 5 everyday money-saving tips that can help you weather the storm of inflation. 1. Create a Budget: Creating a budget is a great way to start when looking to achieve any financial goal. Unfortunately, most people often underestimate the amount of money they spend each month. By making a budget, you will discover how much you spend and how much you need for specific monthly expenses. Once you’ve determined what you spend the most money on, you can easily decide which areas you can afford to cut back on. By cutting back on unnecessary expenses, you’ll have more money you can put in your savings account. 2. Shop With Cash: When using a debit or credit card primarily, it can be easy to lose track of how much you’re actually spending. If you use cash instead, you’ll notice how much you spend on every purchase.   Once you’ve determined your budget, you can easily set aside cash amounts for each category. For example, if you’ve budgeted $250 a month for groceries, set that amount aside and use it whenever you go to the grocery store. This can help you prevent overspending. 3. Sell Unused Items: If you find yourself accumulating items you never use, consider selling them to make some extra cash. With online marketplaces like Craigslist, eBay, and Facebook Marketplace, it’s never been easier to advertise the items you want to sell. On top of that, you can also host a yard sale, allowing you to connect with buyers in your area. In addition to making extra money you can save, selling unused items is a great way to keep your house clean and clutter-free. 4. Avoid Brand-Name Items: When shopping at the grocery store, you’ll have plenty of opportunities to choose a more cost-effective product. Aside from the price, many brand-name items are indiscernible from their generic counterparts. Whether it’s over-the-counter medications, groceries, or toiletries, many stores offer their own brand for a fraction of the cost. By choosing these cheaper products, you can easily cut down on your monthly grocery bill, allowing you to save more money. 5. Automate Your Savings: Lastly, automating your savings is one of the easiest ways to ensure you’re saving money. Many payroll and bank services allow you to set aside a predetermined amount of money every paycheck or month.   By enabling these features in alignment with your budget, you can be sure your money is saved before you have the chance to spend it. This can help you build up your savings or an emergency fund in case of an economic crisis. Time To Get Started: Now that you know these simple steps you can take to save money, it’s time to begin. To help you figure out how quickly your savings can grow, try using a savings calculator like this one by Mint. This information can help guide you through the budget creation process and ensure you’re saving the right amount. "

    "body": "2022/06/13 - A brand’s reputation is its lifeblood. In the highly politicized, constantly digitized and online society of today, it becomes more and more possible that negative opinions can damage a business permanently. It is essential to guard your reputation carefully. Here are some measures you can take to do just that. Be Proactive: The first thing you can do is proactively create a positive narrative. This will come into being by encouraging pleased customers to leave positive reviews. It can also be spread in subtle ways, like through how you market and represent your brand. For example, the grocery chain Trader Joe’s has created a brand that represents organic, delicious, and diverse food, that supports environmental conservation and so on. You can create similar narratives with your brand’s image, through customer policies, and aesthetic elements (either online or in person) that reflect that narrative. Avoid Negative Attention: As obvious as this one might seem, it has never been easier to get your company roped into controversy. First of all, following GARM standards can help your brand stay away from controversy. GARM (Global Alliance for Responsible Media) strives to avoid representations or references to problematic and harmful content. You can also avoid posting about or openly supporting causes that could be seen as political, since you could potentially alienate or anger one-half of your potential customers. Be careful to deal with customer reviews or accusations of inappropriate conduct by keeping careful records and training employees. Have protocols in place for such occurrences. Prevention really is the best cure. Be an Upstanding Business: While it is true that sometimes controversy is unavoidable, the fact is that those occasions are rare. Most controversy is entirely avoidable, and it is best avoided by being responsible and honest. Predict possible problems that could crop up and do your best to provide your customers and employees with the safe environment that they deserve. If or when something does happen that could damage your reputation, honestly assess how much of the event was the fault of the business. Make conscious and public effort to make effective changes in whatever system you need to in order to make things better. Use social media (and any other brand-related interface) to uplift and build rather than tear down. A reputation should be robust and positive, but it should also be built on good policies and honest dealings. While it may be tempting to take financial or logistical shortcuts to save money or time, you might regret such decisions later on. Make sure to build and maintain a good reputation that will last for years to come! For more advice on how to build your six-figure business from the ground-up, check out my book here! "

    "body": "2022/05/30 - If you don’t keep track of the finances in your business, there is a lot of room for error. It’s important to keep your finances in order to keep everything running smoothly. To ensure everything goes well, be sure to keep track of these important numbers. Your Expenses: When you’re running a business, you need to keep track of your expenses. Not knowing how much your company is spending can cause potential damage to your company. Expenses are necessary costs that it takes to run your business. You need to pay for a business space, a website domain, a payment portal, the acquisition of your products, and more. These expenses allow you to run your business, but if you don’t keep track of your expenses, you can end up spending too much and damage your bottom line. Spending too much on expenses puts your business in the red. If your expenses outweigh your profits, you’ll continue to go deeper and deeper into debt until you’re forced to close your business. Keeping track of your expenses keeps you on top of all your business’ finances. Profits: Your profits are another big number to keep track of within your business. Your profits allow you to continue to pay for and run your business, and provide a livelihood for yourself and your employees. To find your profits, subtract your various expenses from your revenue. Any remaining funds are the profits you’ve made from the sale. You should also understand the difference between profitability and profit. Profit is a fixed amount. You’ll know the exact amount that you received to pay your employees and yourself. However, profitability is an estimation of the profit your business can receive in relation to its size.   Payroll: Without a strong group of employees, your business cannot succeed. It’s impossible to run a successful business all by yourself. You need a team of hardworking employees to make a business successful. It’s critically important to treat your employees well if you want to retain them, and a big part of that is payroll. It’s essential for you to stay on top of your employees’ salaries to pay them for their hard work and keep your company running smoothly. Luckily, there are hundreds of software programs that make keeping track of payroll easy. Running a business isn’t only about the numbers, but it’s important to stay on top of your business’ finances to ensure it remains successful. Money matters should always be handled quickly and with care in your business. In general, these are three of the biggest numbers to keep track of.

Your financial abilities ultimately determine the success of every other aspect of your business. With that in mind, make sure to regularly complete the following accounting tasks to stay on top of your finances! Track Expenses: Keeping track of the expenses of your business is not only essential for budgeting and tax purposes, but it also helps you to be a better business owner. The expenses you incur help you to be able to know how much you need to charge your customers to make a profit. Finding the balance between how much things cost and how much you sell them for is essential. Keeping track of expenses also helps you be more financially aware. If you keep track of what you spend every day on your business, you’ll be able to cut the less necessary expenses and prioritize important ones. You can make these changes as they happen, rather than waiting until your finances are suffering. Doing this as a daily task will also keep you organized and prepared come tax season. Manage Payroll: Another essential accounting task you need to do regularly is to manage the payroll for your employees. It’s a legal requirement to pay your employees fairly for the work they do, and it also helps keep your employees motivated to know they’re working toward a reward. This is a task that you usually do every other week when you compile your employees’ hours to send out their paychecks. Using software for payroll management can reduce errors and speed up the process. This software automatically deducts the taxes from your employees’ paychecks to help you properly pay and keep track of taxes. Prepare and Pay Taxes: This is one of the big accounting tasks that business owners need to do yearly. Preparing and paying taxes comes after you prepare your year-end financial statement. This document keeps track of expenses, profits, losses, and every financial change that has occurred throughout the year, and is the information you’ll use to prepare and file your taxes. The responsibility to complete all of this is on you, the business owner. However, the filing of the taxes can and often should be done by a tax professional, so that you can make sure no mistakes were made. As a business owner, finances are one of the most important aspects of your business that you need to regularly monitor. Accounting tasks help you keep track of these finances, and keep your business in the black. Keep track of and complete these accounting tasks regularly to keep your business doing well.

When you can keep all your business elements organized, you will be able to ensure that you are always prepared for the events that are coming up. All you have to do is figure out a few key methods that can keep you organized and help your business to be even more successful. Keep Track of Information in Spreadsheets: Information is one of the main things that you need to keep organized, and you can make that happen on your computer. Using spreadsheets to organize business information is a great way to make sure you know where all your info is. And, you can reorganize spreadsheets in a variety of ways depending on your needs for any particular day. There are many different spreadsheet programs you can use, and they each have their own benefits. The best thing you can do is choose an option that is tailored to your needs as a business owner.   Use a Cloud Software: You also want to organize and back up your data so you know it is safe and available when you need it. You can store data locally with your own server, but this method is often not the most cost effective for small businesses. Cloud software can make storing data easy and secure. And with a cloud storage option, you don’t have to worry about maintaining the server yourself. Instead you can leave that work to the experts and focus on the specifics of your own business model. Put Together A Schedule: Another element of business that needs to be organized is your time. If you aren’t on top of your schedule, you can miss out on important opportunities or leave your team in the lurch. You should use a calendar or schedule to keep your time straight and ensure that you are where you need to be when you need to be there. An online calendar or schedule is a great option because it is easy to edit from anywhere and share with anyone who needs access. When your business is organized, it will be easier for you to do all the things you need to accomplish and to ensure that your business has the best chance for success.

But even if you are experiencing more growth than expected, you can take steps to handle the influx of clients with ease and use it to your advantage! Allocate Your Time Wisely: The first key to handling all your new clients is to be smart about the way you manage your time. Make sure that you don’t agree to deadlines that you can’t make, and once you have set your schedule, do your best to stick to it.

You can hire new team members to help you to manage your time and your new clients in the best possible way. Even though you may need new workers in a hurry, you don’t want to rush the process. Make sure you do a thorough job vetting your applicants so you know that you have made solid hires. Conducting an interview is all about asking the right questions.

But if you make the mistake of ignoring your competitors, you could be in trouble. Keeping up with the competition—and pulling ahead of them—can make a huge difference in your bottom line. Understand What They Do Right: Your competitors are staying in business because they’re doing something right, and you need to find out what that is. It’s helpful to regularly monitor their websites and social media posts to understand their services and marketing strategies. Reviews of competing businesses on third-party sites are also helpful in learning what present and former clients are saying about them. If you have a good understanding of what people like about your competitors, you can review your own practices to see how they compare. Armed with this information, you may be able to make changes to your own business model to provide the same or better services. Find Out What They Aren’t Doing: At the same time you’re looking for your competitors’ positives, also look for their negatives. Often, the key to beating competitors is to do what they aren’t doing. These are openings for you to innovate, expand your services, adapt your marketing, and capture their clients’ business. Only half of companies use marketing correctly, creating opportunities for your business. Your competitors may be missing key niche markets that you can zero in on. Or, they may be ignoring trends that you can highlight in your own campaigns. Reaching your target market is essential. Give Something Extra: When similar businesses offer comparable services and prices, the prospective client may be persuaded by the company that gives them just a little extra. Offering discounts on bundled services or extended contracts is one strategy that benefits both the client and you. To attract new clients, try giving bonuses for referring new clients. Improving customer service is another tactic. You might offer quicker delivery or turn-around than your competitors. Personalized service is always appreciated. Taking time to listen to clients and solicit feedback can boost satisfaction and build brand loyalty. Watching your competitors can give you insights into keeping your own business fresh, vital, and relevant. Information about what competing businesses are doing (and not doing) is crucial to understanding the market landscape and assessing where your business can excel.

    "body": "2022/03/21 - The pandemic has altered the course of careers for thousands of people over the last two years. Many have started their own businesses as a result of being furloughed with no end in sight or just straight up losing their jobs. Virtually every person who runs a business out of their home will rely on technology and the internet to some degree, which means that you must take cybersecurity seriously. So what can you do to strengthen it? Protect Your Data: Any business is going to have some amount of data that they use to run their operations. It could be something as minimal as email addresses and contact information, and can extend to sensitive data like tax information. Regardless, it’s crucial to take steps to protect it. You can do this by making sure you always protect everything with strong passwords. If you take your work with you when you’re out and about, make sure you take the physical devices with you instead of leaving them in the car. That way you’re less likely to fall victim to smash-and-grab criminals who could detect your devices with a bluetooth scanner. Use the Right Hardware: When you think about cybersecurity, a lot of what comes to mind probably deals with software. It all starts with your hardware, though. A router can protect information with a basic firewall. Firewalls are an absolute must for cybersecurity. If you have or use IoT devices, take steps to make sure those are protected as well. IoT device shields are definitely a good option to look into. Be Careful with Emails: Anyone who works from home will find themselves communicating via email a lot. Most of the time, the emails you receive will be harmless. They’re likely to be communications from partners, clients, employees, or others contacting you for business-related purposes, or from other companies or business people who are trying to earn your business. Still, some will likely be from malicious sources who will take advantage of any weakness they find. Watch out for email scams so you don’t fall victim to them. If you see suspicious emails, avoid clicking on them altogether and absolutely don’t click on any links in them. Cybersecurity is a big deal for any business, but especially for entrepreneurs running them out of their own homes. Larger, more established businesses may have the money to pay for higher end security, but that doesn’t mean that you can’t strengthen it yourself. The good news here is that you can make simple moves to protect your data, use the right hardware, and exercise caution in general to strengthen your cybersecurity without breaking the bank.

    "title": "How to Change Your Mindset to Achieve Business Success",
    "body": "2022/03/15 - Going out on your own and starting your own business is the most effective and direct route towards the kind of financial independence and time freedom that so many people dream of. But the truth is that to become a successful entrepreneur and businessperson, you need to have the proper mindset. Discovering this success mindset is easier said than done and can take years of trial and error to discover what works and what doesn’t. To help you get started here are three ways that you can change your mindset to achieve business success faster than you ever imagined possible. Set Bold but Realistic Goals: The first mindset change that you need to make to achieve the business success that you crave is to set bold but realistic goals. Too many entrepreneurs and aspiring business owners set goals that are simply inappropriate to drive them to success. If you set goals that are too small and easy, you aren’t pushing yourself beyond your capabilities, limiting your growth and drive. On the other hand, if you set your sights too high, you can burn out and get discouraged when you fall short of lofty goals. Try setting goals that push you harder but are still achievable and reasonable. Become Growth-Oriented: The next mindset change that you can make to help achieve business success is to become growth oriented. The success of your bluishness is important, and for most people, success means growing in revenue, sales, and customer base. In order to accelerate your growth, you need to have a solid understanding of business. Make sure that you are constantly seeking to learn more about what successful business operations look like, and what your contemporaries and predecessors have done to achieve the success that they have today. Treat Failures as Learning Experiences: The final mindset change that you need to make to achieve the business success that you crave is to treat your failures as learning experiences. Failure is a rite of passage for successful business owners. First time entrepreneurs can often feel that their failures are a sign that they aren’t cut out for business. But failure is how business people learn and come back stronger and better than before. Treat your failures as an opportunity to learn for your next venture, and never take your eyes off your goals. Achieving business success is not easy; it requires the cultivation of a successful mindset to truly see business success. Try adjusting your mindset in these three ways and watch as success comes to you. Need help marketing your business? Get a step by step guide here! "

    "body": "2022/03/11 - Business owners know that taxes are not a simple matter. Whether you have several employees or you’re a sole proprietor, your tax situation will likely be complex and based on factors unique to you and your business. While there’s no “one size fits all” when it comes to taxes on businesses, there are some areas that you need to know about. Federal and State Taxes: The legal structure of your business—sole proprietorship, partnership, LLC, or other—will affect the way your federal and state taxes are handled. The structure you choose will depend on the size and operations of your business, but you should consult an accountant about your individual tax planning. Planning in advance is necessary to make sure you will have the funds on hand to pay the taxes you owe. Most business owners will pay quarterly taxes, which are prepayments on the estimated total federal taxes that will be due for the tax year. This applies to sole proprietors, partners, and members of an LLC, as well as individuals who work as contractors and freelancers. Some states also require quarterly payments for their taxes. Self-Employment Taxes: Self-employment taxes are extra taxes that cover contributions to social security and Medicare. The self-employment tax rate is 15. 3%; 12. 4% to go toward social security and the remainder toward Medicare. These taxes are added to the amount you owe for federal income tax. The self-employment tax doesn’t just apply to independent contractors or sole proprietors. An LLC owner needs to pay self-employment taxes on all their business profits. Partners must also pay self-employment taxes on their personal as well as their business income. Deductions: Understanding deductions is crucial to business owners who want to reduce the amount of tax they owe. The IRS will allow what they consider “ordinary and necessary” deductions. The tricky part comes in knowing what deductions the IRS considers necessary. Common deductions include business operations costs such as insurance and loan interest, vehicle expenses, advertising costs, legal fees, and office supplies. Travel and meal expenses may also be deductible. Individual businesses differ, so you should consult an accountant before claiming a deduction. Although taxes for businesses and self-employment can be complicated, having a solid understanding of tax laws and procedures can help. With advanced planning, you can legally reduce the amount of taxes you owe and pay them on time. For more information on handling your own business, check out my ebook here! "

    "title": "How to Avoid Employee Burnout at Your Company",
    "body": "2022/02/10 - As you are running a business you have to mind the balance between making sure that your employees are productive and happy in the workplace? As someone who’s struggled with corporate burnout, I can test that it is not a place you want your employees or team members to get to. When you can strike that balance you can avoid burnout and ensure that your employees are loyal and able to work hard to make things run smoothly. As you work to make the workplace a positive environment for your employees, you can start to create a healthy place for great work to be accomplished. Encourage Vacation Time: It has recently become trendy to promote unlimited paid time off for your employees. This technique actually works great, but in addition to offering the PTO, you have to create a culture where your employees are encouraged to use the time they have. You don’t have to offer unlimited vacation time, but you do need to encourage using vacation time, and actively work to show that taking vacations is a good thing. When you can make that happen for your team, they will be able to take breaks when they need them and come back feeling excited about their work and more able to produce great things. Be Clear About Roles: Burnout can happen at any business, but it happens most when people aren’t sure what their role is at the company. When this happens, your employees may take on more than they should and become burned out after a short period of time. When roles are clearly designated, your employees will know what they need to do and what they should not do so they can have clear boundaries about their work life. Process mapping clearly outlines who does what and the standards used to measure success. Build in Break Time: It’s important that your employees know that they can take breaks, and that they take advantage of them. Encourage your employees to schedule their main breaks on their calendar as if they are meetings. That way they won’t be pulled into work when they are supposed to be taking a break. It can also help to create a comfortable break area that actually helps your employees to relax.

    "body": "2022/02/01 -  How to Start as a Freelancer and Become Successful These days, many people are starting to think about how they can ditch the standard office job and find success as a freelancer. The fact is that advancements in technology are making this dream more possible than ever before and there are many jobs that you can do on your own schedule. As an expert on working and finding success online, entrepreneur Kate Bagoy knows what it takes to accomplish your freelance dreams. To help you out, she has compiled some tips on how to find your dream career. Types of Freelance Work Are you interested in starting a freelance career, but you don’t know where to start? The good news is that if there is something that you enjoy doing then there is likely a freelance job that can use your talents. For example, if you have a love for the written language then you could become a freelance writer. If you love being on the go then you could get a job as a driver. If you enjoy music then you could give music lessons online.   You could even work freelance in several different industries at once. While this new career may count as passive income now, if you find success then you could turn it into your full-time job. Starting a Business Once you decide on the type of freelance work you want to do, you need to spend some time creating the best business entity for your needs. Many freelancers set themselves up as a sole proprietorship, there is also the option to create a limited liability corporation.   As an LLC, you can take advantage of many perks including less paperwork, more flexibility, and you may even save money come tax time. While an LLC is easy to set up, you must be aware that Texas may have certain rules and regulations that you’ll need to follow, so it is a good idea to use a formation service to ensure that you are in full compliance when you start bringing on clients. Check out this great guide from LLC. org to learn how to start an LLC in your state. Finding Clients Once you are up and running, you will want to start making money and to do that, you will need to find customers. Doing so can be tough at the start, but you can begin by posting your services on social media or even hanging fliers at busy restaurants or the library.   As part of your marketing efforts, you should at least set up a strong web presence with a website that showcases all of your skills. When you have satisfied customers, you can post their positive reviews on your site. You can also ask them to refer their friends, and if you continue to work hard, you could grow your business by leaps and bounds in no time. Make sure to keep your website updated and advertise it wherever possible. Set Your Pay Once you are up and running, you will want to set your rates. A good way to start is to look at similar businesses, see what they charge, and then go lower or higher depending on your level of experience. Another way to determine your pay rate is to look at all of your expenses each month. Then, think about how many jobs you can take in that time. Now, think about what you need to charge per job in order to pay your bills and have a bit leftover in profit.   Be Patient While your dream may be to turn this passive income stream into a full-time job, it is important not to rush it. Success will not happen overnight and if you rush then you may make costly mistakes that could set you back further. This is why it may be necessary to keep your steady job for now until you get up and running. Remember that you will have bad days, but if you don’t give up then you can eventually find the success that you crave. As you can see, there is a lot that goes into freelancing and earning passive income, but once you have your system down, success will not be far away.

    "body": "2022/01/11 - As a freelancer, you can create many wonderful opportunities for yourself that can give you a better experience than other career types. However, it also comes along with challenges. As you enter the world of freelancing, you need to take time to understand these challenges, how to deal with them, and whether or not you can handle them. You Have to Search for Clients: Freelancers do their work for whoever has a need for it. This makes things very flexible, but it leaves you with a big problem. You are responsible for finding your own clients. Without clients, you can’t work. In order to find clients, you need to employ several strategies. First of all, you need to make sure people can find your information. You should have up to date job profiles, social media pages, and even a website. One of the best ways to bring people to your profiles, is to create some sort of content. For example, creating a blog can bring people interested in your blog topics to your website. Once you’ve established your presence online, you also need to find ways to market yourself and make people aware of your business. You’re Accountable to Yourself: One of the most challenging parts of being a freelancer is being accountable to yourself. You don’t have a traditional schedule or someone else to answer to. If you want to succeed, you need to keep yourself in check. You have to learn to stay on top of multiple tasks as a freelancer. You are in charge of everything related to your business, so you need to be the one keeping everything organized. It can be helpful to create a schedule of all the tasks you need to get done so you don’t lose track of anything. You can also create goals for yourself and actually hold yourself accountable to those goals. Doing so is a great way to ensure you achieve everything you need to. Inconsistent Work: Due to the nature of freelancing, there will be periods of time where you won’t have any work. This is true of professionals and those just getting started and there isn’t really a way you can avoid it. However, there are things you can do when work is limited. You can use that time to build your brand, market, or reflect on the work you’ve done so far. It can also be helpful if you have some sort of financial safety net to support you during any dry spells. Working as a freelancer can be very rewarding. You can be more flexible with your time and who you work with. If you choose to go into freelancing, make sure you take stock of the common challenges you might face.   Need help marketing your business? Get a step-by-step guide here! "

Technology is simply a part of the global economy, and your business needs it. But that doesn’t mean technology isn’t sometimes frustrating and hard to manage. But for all the headaches it can cause, it also offers solutions to some of the problems of running business that can revolutionize how you operate. Here are three technology solutions that your business just can’t run without. Productivity Software: Despite the name, productivity software is not some magical piece of software that is going to optimize productivity and make your team magically increase their workload by double. Productivity software is, however, an essential technology for business that does provide some improvements to productivity. Productivity software is simply any software that assists in the creation of business type information like worksheets, databases, charts, graphs, documents and just about anything else. Things like the office suite are productivity software. Basically, your business needs it, and likely already has it. If your business isn’t providing productivity software to your team members, you should. Cloud Services: If you are still storing your business data on a private, personal database, then you are also behind the times. Cloud services are almost always a better place for data storage. The cloud allows you to access your data from anywhere in the world with the internet, while simultaneously harnessing the massive cybersecurity network that cloud services have to offer. A private cloud offers more control and flexibility over a public cloud option. Public cloud options often offer lower cost plans however, so the choice is yours. Optimizing SEO: SEO, or search engine optimization, is the final technological solution that your business needs to operate successfully. Every time you use a search engine, you are going to be given a ranked list of results. If you have ever wondered what decides the ranking, here is your answer: SEO. SEO is a series of principles and best practices that can help your site do well in the algorithm the search engines use to create result rankings. This can land your site in the top two or three sites listed for searches for relevant terms, which can lead to huge volume growth for your online business. Technology is the wave of the future. Running a business is hard, but technology can make it just a tiny bit easier.

    "title": "Guest Post: Mastering the LinkedIn Platform for Ultimate Lead Generation",
    "body": "2022/01/06 - Unlike other traffic-heavy social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram, LinkedIn is the ultimate destination for effective lead generation. As LinkedIn harnesses a crowd of professional users, it makes every attempt to grow your business worthwhile.   Evidently enough, 92% of B2B marketers use LinkedIn for lead generation because of the success it guarantees. Such a platform might be the best bet for small business owners to have exponential growth.   That said, it does not magically happen overnight even if you google how to network on LinkedIn a million times. You would have to put in the effort to create innovative campaigns, generate leads, network with the right people, and retain those connections. Here is a short guide on what you should keep in mind before you expect lead generation.   Make a Business Page : To make a real difference in generating leads, it is best that you create a LinkedIn business page. Not only is it more effective to run a company from a business page, but it also separates your identity from that of the company.   Here is a short guide on how to create a LinkedIn business page:  Go to the top-right corner of your homepage and select the Work icon  Click on Create a Company Page Pick your page type from the options:     Small business   Medium to large business   Showcase page   Educational institution (high school or university/college)    Enter your page identity, company details, and profile details Check the verification box to confirm that you can control the company’s account  Select Create page Click on Start building your page! to build out your business profileWith this ammo in your hand, you can pump out brand-centric content and company updates while expanding your range of customers.   LinkedIn Marketing : If your brand is new to the business world, let us introduce you to the minefield that is LinkedIn marketing. Over 80% of B2B leads generated through social media come from LinkedIn alone, which means that you could reap substantial benefits if you get your marketing game right.   Your marketing strategies can be organic or paid, that is, through content marketing on your page or advertisement campaigns. Through the latest video feature on LinkedIn, you can create engaging videos or host live streams on your profile to promote your brand image.   However, instead of stringing together concepts, perform a thorough evaluation of your brand image and how you can capitalize on a unique theme. By following trends or generating unique marketing stints, you can expand your customer base by making content that appeals to them.   Advertisement Campaigns : Even though the public would generally consider Facebook advertising campaigns the better option because of the sheer number of users, LinkedIn advertisement campaigns usually generate more leads due to the value vested in the user base.   Hubspot compiled their data from sponsored content on LinkedIn, and they noticed that while the cost-per-click is higher for LinkedIn, the conversion rate is double that of any other platform.   As a business owner, you can target your LinkedIn audience to minute details like:   Company industry, size, and name Job title, function, and senioritySo, if your service is dedicated to senior positions, you can target that specific demographic and bolster your sales. Unlike a traffic-heavy website, your advertisements will not get scattered across the platform to people who might not even care about them.   Network : To thrive in any space, it is vital that you network with other users. In LinkedIn especially, you can reach a wide range of users with the networking feature. By networking with notable personalities, you can expand your business drastically as it will reach their connections as well.   Around 20% of LinkedIn users have purchasing power for their companies, which means you can reach influential figures if you generate high-quality content and advertisements. LinkedIn is also used by most Fortune 500 companies and getting into similar networking spaces would mean soaring success for your company.   To be perceived as a storehouse of valuable information, you can begin posting content-heavy articles that are informative and engaging, as such content can appear off-site as well. You can also post polls on your page to increase engagement and host giveaways or similar activities as innovative marketing tactics.   Another golden feature to boost your networking game is LinkedIn groups. You can join groups that are beneficial for your company in any means and form acquaintances with notable figures.   Along with conversing with other people, you can post informational content which is non-promotional to gain the stamp of authenticity within such circles. Key Takeaways: LinkedIn has a plethora of features for you to maximize your influence on targeted audiences. To get the most of it, you need to remain updated with LinkedIn features and make sure that you follow the right way to approach it.   Here is what you can take away from this article to generate leads:  Instead of using your page to promote your brand, create a LinkedIn business page so that you can have a brand image separate from yours  Initiate unique marketing stints by being staying updated with LinkedIn features and following social media trends to expand your customer base Start advertising campaigns on LinkedIn to generate leads and make use of its features to grow your reach by targeting valuable demographic Network with notable figures within your industry by reaching out to them via comments or personal messages and joining LinkedIn groups where you can create a good impression for your company before a larger audience All said and done, note that your marketing stints will not work unless you do.

    "body": "2022/01/05 - For decades, having a 9-5 full-time job has been touted as a reliable way to make money. Few people today have the luxury of limiting their money-making efforts to a single full-time job though. Inflation never seems to stop, and getting ahead always seems to require more effort. So what can you do to earn more money outside of your 9-5 job? Become a Freelancer: Do you have any specific skills? If so, you could leverage those to become a freelancer. A freelancer is an independent contractor. They earn money on a per-task basis. As a freelancer, you can negotiate your pay rate more easily than you could as an employee.

Once you know what to charge for your services, start looking for clients. Cultivate client relationships to increase your odds of a steady income and overall success.

Consider the ubiquitous Uber and Lyft rideshare services. Plenty of people find this route to be a great way to make money in their spare time. There are a few things to keep in mind if you pursue this route though. Using your personal vehicle can mean you have to take steps to clean the seats of your car more frequently. You’ll also likely have to make changes to your car insurance to make sure you’re adequately covered. Run Errands for Others: Giving people rides isn’t the only way to earn money by doing an everyday task for other people. You can make money by doing errands for them too. Become an Instacart shopper or run deliveries through DoorDash, UberEats, or PostMates. Check out care. com too. Lots of people request help for all sorts of things on this site, from housekeeping to tutoring. TaskRabbit is another similar platform you could use to find work doing random jobs in your local area.

    "body": "2022/01/04 - Once you get your business off the ground, you might think you’re all set. However, not all businesses last, especially if they don’t use the right strategies up front. It’s essential for you to find the best ways to make your business last and promote longevity.   Ensure Profitability: As a business, your primary goal is to ensure you make a profit. Altitude Advisory points out that you have many resources to ensure profitability in your business. One thing you can do is prioritize the things that are making you money. Take a look at your business so far and see what products and services are the most profitable. Once you’ve done so, remove anything that isn’t pulling in a major profit. Minding this closely is important to longevity and success.  You don’t need to be investing in anything that isn’t helping you make money. You can also increase your profitability by reducing your costs. Spending less will help you make more off of your sales. It can be helpful to review your current spending and see what isn’t absolutely necessary. Create a Comprehensive Plan: One thing that causes businesses to fail is the lack of a plan. If you don’t have any kind of plan for your business, whether short or long term, then you don’t have anything to work toward. Every business needs a longevity plan for greater sustainability, according to Franchise Gator. Your plan should include all your goals and how you will actually achieve these goals. It can be helpful to identify what your main long-term goals are, such as doubling your customer base, and then breaking them down into smaller goals. For example if you are trying to increase your customer base, your plan can include goals such as doing market research, implementing new marketing strategies, or creating a referral program for current clients. With a detailed plan, you have a better chance of success. Learn to Adapt: The best thing you can do for your business is learn to adapt to new circumstances. You can’t keep running your business the exact same way forever. Things are constantly changing and you need to learn how to change with them. For example, since the COVID-19 pandemic began, many businesses needed to learn how to operate remotely. This resulted in many of them making permanent changes that actually improved their businesses. In order to have business longevity, you need to learn how to adapt to challenges and incorporate new practices to keep your business going. Every business owner wants to see their business last a long time. The difference between those who do and those who don’t is how they prepare and manage their business. Make sure you employ the right strategies to help your business last. Want to start a six-figure business? Get my top secrets here! "

    "body": "2021/12/30 - One of the most difficult parts of running a business is balancing your budget and making sure you have the funds you need to get things done. There are some monthly expenses that are absolutely essential and need to be a part of your monthly budget. On the other hand, there are also expenses that many businesses pay for each month that aren’t really necessary to making sure that your business is as successful as it should be. Software: It’s likely that there are some software expenses that you will need to pay each month or purchase upfront. But there are other software needs that can be met with free options that are still amazing resources for your company. If you are feeling like you might be spending too much on your software, it may be time to look around and see if there are free software options available that can actually help you to do even better with your daily tasks. If you can find free versions that get the job done, it can save your business a lot of money. A Phone Line: Some businesses are still using a landline or mobile phone to take care of calls. This option is expensive, and it is usually totally avoidable since you can make calls over the network using your internet connection. VoIP makes it easy to make and take calls using just the internet. So if your business still is paying for a landline and internet, it might be time to make the switch and close your landline. You can often even use the same phone number for your VoIP calls, so the transition can be incredibly smooth. Missing Deductions: It’s important that your business is thorough in filing taxes and that you take advantage of all the deductions you are qualified for. If you aren’t doing this, you may find that you are spending more on taxes than you should, and that can land you in financial trouble if you don’t rectify the issues. It may seem like an added expense to hire an accountant, but they can help you to file your taxes more effectively so you don’t spend unnecessarily. Taking care of your business is important and balancing your budget is a huge part of that. Take time to look through your budget and figure out what extra expenses you may not need to spend on. That will help you to decrease your costs and keep things running as well as possible. Ready to start your consulting business? Grab my book and get started today! "

You have to get the work done on time, meet customer expectations and handle surroundings tactfully.   This is one job all of us have tried at some point, but very few of us succeeded in managing it. Working from home as a freelancer is one dare for which you need peace, a lot of motivation and a whole heap of patience. You get distracted once, and boom, all focus down in wane. We, have a tough time concentrating on work when surrounded by an environment full of distractions. No matter how many times we convince ourselves not to heed these interferences, we cannot Keep ourselves from  these distractions.   There are tasks that need urgent deliveries and complete concentration. The surroundings do matter when it comes to efficient work. If there are a lot of noises, which distract your focus, then you might lose interest in completing that task. Following are the twelve fail-proof productivity hacks that can boost your work efficiency and improve your freelance productivity. Find Your Work Space And Eliminate Distractions : The cleverest hacks to accelerate your efficiency while working as freelancers include a decent workspace with no interferences.  Image source A decent workspace doesn’t mean investing in a workplace or office but advancing your workstation. You can spend a small amount on a good table and chair or a fitting seat and desk that can offer comfort and solace from uninvited throbbing and back pains. To eliminate distractions, you can consider on  Using headphones  Shutting room doors switching off cellphoneMake a To-Do List: Your to-do list can do wonders! Jot down all you aspire to achieve for the month. You can either use your notepad or mobile application for this practice, the one that suits you best.  Image source After you have jotted down all your tasks, make a list based on weekly goals. Extract what you need to dispatch first and sequence your errands accordingly. You can also add in your daily household jobs and function suitably, which can help you stay focused on your work, and you won’t wander or lose track of things. The focus this practice will award is crucial for freelancers to work efficiently and proficiently. Set Your Goals And Work Time Wisely: While making your to-do list, you must set your goals and time wisely. If you fail to do so, you might end up going off on a tangent, which can be detrimental for your freelance work. Experts recommend synchronizing clear goals so you can line up your targets correctly and manage the time effectively.   Image source Setting goals help you work efficiently, accelerate productivity and boost efficacy so you can fulfill your purposes and accomplish your objectives. You might not believe it, but setting goals and time help shape your missions and produce better results. Break Bigger Tasks Into Smaller Ones: Consider dividing your bigger tasks into smaller ones to make your work easier and stress-free. You can allot different days for different tasks or split the same job into different days. For instance, if you are working on a research paper, allocate separate days for literature review and background and then manage data collection, discussion, conclusion, etc.  Image source The smaller your task is divided, the more specific your work will be, and the more specific your work is, the better your accuracy will be. By this work specification, the focus is narrowed down and will eventually result in better outputs. Take Short Breaks: Working tirelessly without taking any breaks can never result in productivity; instead, it will have adverse effects on productivity, and you will end up delivering terrible work. According to reports, short breaks during work improves efficiency and recharge your capacities. This might seem a paradox to you, but in truth, working for too long without any breaks is your worst enemy in generating quality work.   When you work straight for more than four hours, your level of focus deteriorates, resulting in the decreased excellence of your work.  Image source However, the break doesn’t mean hour-long breaks. Instead, you can take a lunch break, go for a short walk, or pause for a rest. Cut Down Social Media Time While Working: The biggest and the cruelest practice that can decelerate your productivity is using social media while working. No doubt, social media can bring you a lot of pros too, but this one con is above all.   Social media brings distractions and is considered as one of the biggest enemies of productivity. If you think you can work efficiently surfing around social media, let me be clear, you cannot.   According to Dissertation Editing Services, the biggest barrier they face while working on their tasks is social media. To curb this, most of them recommend disabling notifications and enabling silent mode, so they don’t peek at their phones, which ultimately will result in limited use of cell phones and social channels.   Use Sticky Notes For Deadlines And Reminders: Sticky notes are a great way to stay up-to-date with your goals. If you have time limits and a lot of work to do in less time, try utilizing these colorful pieces of paper or your onscreen sticky notes to remember your closing dates.  Image source You can also add your random daily errands and keep posted about your work schedules. Schedule Time For The Outside World: Many freelancers limit themselves to their shells and disconnect from the outside world. This isolation brings negative impacts to the behavior, and in the long run, the person becomes lonely and detached from the social world.  Image source Whether you are an employee, employer or freelancer, you must never overlook the outside community. Socializing improves your professional communication, makes you welcoming and adaptable to many changes that are a must possess for professional life. Oftentimes these interactions make your connections and expose you to your target clients that can be beneficial for both your character and professional growth. So instead of being clung to your computer screen, go out on the town. Take out time for your family and friends and head with them to your favorite places because adhering to your monitor will drive you crazy, and you will lose all flexibility. Track Your Time And Assess Performance: Two of the best favors you can do for yourself is tracking your time and assessing the output. Track time to analyze how much time you consumed completing a single task.   Jot your tracks for a week and see how many changes you can make. The better you keep an eye on your timings, the more focused and prudent you will become. Also, every time you track your time, assess your performance too. Take a look to see if things went as you planned and are they worth the release. If things are according to your plans, excellent, but if not, examine where you went wrong and try to alter it.   Concentrate On A Single Job Than Multitasking : It’s good to multitask, but this practice sometimes can ruin all of your efforts and result in a disaster. Many freelancers work on a number of projects and bring out results that are not worthy or of no value. Make sure you are not one of those.  Image source It’s better to focus on a sole plan and produce commendable results than work on several tasks and generate lamentable outcomes. Learn To Say No : Have the guts to say no to customers for the work you don’t feel like doing or have no energy to put the effort in. It doesn’t matter if your client is your friend, family, or acquaintance; if you don’t have the strength to fulfill it, don’t force yourself. Remember, an understanding fellow won’t impose his work on you, and the one who does is not your friend but a foe. Learn the difference. Pay Attention To Quality Over Quantity : Learn by heart; no matter what, quality will always have a preference over quantity. Your worth is not determined by the number of tasks you are completing but the value of the work you are producing. Never run after the number of orders; instead, always prefer the excellence of work.

    "title": "Guest Post-6 Best Practices for Successful Email Marketing With Gmail",
    "body": "2021/12/16 -  Image Source 1. 5 billion people use Gmail for their communication and information needs. With over a billion active users, Gmail is one of the most visited websites globally. In fact, as a marketer, you probably have your Gmail account open 24/7. Considering the dominance of Gmail, your email marketing campaign needs to be suited to the specific guidelines and preferences of Google’s email service.   This article details six ways that you can craft an effective email marketing strategy using Gmail. Learn the ins and outs of Gmail. Before you even attempt to harness the power of Gmail for email marketing, make sure that you’ve mastered the use of Gmail itself. Familiarize yourself with Gmail shortcuts and use two-factor authentication for tighter security. You should also use labels to organize emails and take advantage of the Smart Reply and Templates (canned responses) features. Gmail also has an “Undo send” option that can save you from an embarrassing email mishap, and you can select how long you will be able to undo a sent message (5-30 seconds). And did you know that you can establish a delegate who can control your Gmail account? This can be used within a company to ensure smooth communication flows, or even within the marketing department. Pay attention to Gmail’s guidelines and relevant laws. Gmail trusts emails that come from authentic and verifiable sources only. If your email is missing one of the essential guidelines, it will probably end up in the Spam folder. Use the list below as a checklist for preventing your email from being marked as spam:  Have a clear sender address containing your name or your company’s name.  Proofread your email.  Avoid spammy subject lines.  Be honest. Do not use threats or deception to get people to open your email.    In addition, make sure to read and follow the relevant rules governing email marketing in the country where you operate. In the US, you’ll have to comply with the CAN-SPAM Act. If you have clients in the EU, read up on the E-Privacy Directive and GDPR (General Data Protection Legislation). One important rule from the CAN-SPAM Act is that you should make it easy for email recipients to unsubscribe from your emails. Otherwise, some customers might find a different way to stop receiving your emails, such as marking them as spam. This will then affect your reputation. In writing subject lines, avoid using too much capitalization and exclamation marks. Also, learn how to arouse emotion without being dishonest. For example, use the principle of urgency marketing to get people to want to buy your product. Authenticate your messages. Your domain provider will provide you with authentication methods. Use your domain hosting service or email provider’s instructions for establishing authentication.   To prevent your emails from getting labeled as spam, set up these authentication methods:  Publish a Sender Policy Framework (SPF) record for your domain to prevent spammers from sending unauthorized messages that look like they’re from your domain.  Turn on DomainKeys Identified Mail signing for your messages. DKIM is used to verify that the domain owner was the one who sent the message.  Publish a Domain-based Message Authentication (DMARC) for your domain to protect the domain against email spoofing. Develop good timing and cadence for sending emails. If you don’t send an email to your customers for a long time and then suddenly blast them with a promotional email, Gmail will get suspicious. Start gradually by sending out emails to a list of close contacts whom you know will open your messages. Slowly increase the number of emails you send from there, until you reach a comfortable send rate.   One more thing to consider is the timing of your email. Will a customer check emails at 1 am? Probably not. But people usually check their emails upon waking up and before going to bed, so 6 am and 8 pm are optimal times for sending out emails. Prioritize sending emails to the most engaged users. Only send emails to people who have agreed to receive messages from you. Additionally, make sure to confirm a user’s email address before listing them as a subscriber. Regularly send emails to confirm that the recipients want to stay subscribed. Purge unresponsive recipients from your email list before they mark you as spam.  Checking out who among your email recipients engage most with your emails is not just a matter of checking customer loyalty, it is also a way to make sure that your content is appealing to your target audience. Though unsubscribing recipients who don’t read your emails may sound counterintuitive at first, it is actually better to focus on sending emails to the select people who care about your messages and your brand. Split test your emails for best results. If you have two versions of an email and you want to know which one would get more engagement before sending out the email to a larger audience, then split testing is for you. You can have two variations of the same message, or you can send the same email at two different times. Afterwards, check which email gets more responses and retain it. This practice will help you get more conversions and  improve customer experience at the same time. Conclusion: Maximizing Gmail for marketingGmail is far from perfect, but it gives users a lot at zero cost. For companies that want to manage business expenses in marketing, opting to use Gmail for email marketing is a wise idea. An email marketer who wants to harness the power of Gmail should learn the basics of Gmail, read Gmail’s guidelines, authenticate messages, follow proper timing, send messages to engaged users, and split test emails.   [author] [author_image timthumb=’on’]https://katebagoy. com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kat-Sarmiento. jpg[/author_image] [author_info]Kat writes articles with the hopes of reaching out to more people.

    "title": "Guest Post: 5 Niche Markets To Start a Business and Be the First In",
    "body": "2021/12/09 - “It’s Better to be First than to Be Better. ” And so goes the First Law of Marketing in the bestselling book, “The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing”. We’ve all seen businesses that played by this law and achieved phenomenal success. Examples are Tide the first laundry detergent, Gillette the first safety razor, and HP the first laser printer. Experts argue that playing by this rule is the only way you can succeed. But then, what do you do if all the niches are already taken?  In that case, the Second Law of Marketing kicks in:  “If all the niches are taken, create a new niche you can be the first in. ” So, what exactly is a niche market? A niche market is essentially a small part of the market at large, consisting of an audience with its own unique needs and preferences.   Consider the weight loss market, for example, which makes up a huge market with massive demand. However, not all weight-conscious people have the same needs and preferences. Some people want to lose weight fast and are looking for quick fixes. Others prefer a holistic approach that gives them long-lasting results.   Now, in the above example, we have two different groups of people – each creating a new niche market within the Weight Loss category.   In this post, we’ll take a dig at how to create a new niche market and give examples and ideas of some of the best eCommerce niches that you can tap into. How to Create a New Niche Market: Here are some common ways businesses niche down and choose a beachhead to conquer before entering the mass market.    Price Differentiations: Products with high, mid-range, and low-price points - termed as luxury, moderate, and discount respectively.   Products targeted for different demographics like gender, age, income level, and education level: For example, you can create a learning website with courses specifically for college dropouts.  Quality differences: Differentiate a product by its level of quality – premium, handmade, and economical.  Products targeted towards specific interests of people: for example, an apparel brand for Active people.  Products for people belonging to a specific location: Offer products/services specifically for the people in your city, for example.   5 Market Trends You Can Use To Create New Niches: Another interesting way to create a new niche is by looking out for what’s trending in the market and how customers’ behaviors and interests are changing.   Innovating a new product that’s one of its kind isn’t always that easy. But capturing a new trend and creating a product that serves the new emerging market might be more doable.   The following trends have been spotted in the market recently – each presenting an untapped business opportunity.   1 - Products for Environmentally Conscious Consumers: According to a 2020 study by IBM, today’s consumers are becoming increasingly purpose-driven. They want products that align with their values and are even willing to pay a premium to brands that stand for what they consider important. Reducing environmental impact and sustainability are some of the biggest social causes consumers believe in.   This trend has created an amazing niche opportunity. Every product with a reasonable market ought to have an environmental-friendly, cruelty-free, or vegan alternative that the conscious consumer will readily embrace. If other players haven’t already created one, you can easily be the first. In the past, purpose-driven businesses meant donating a portion of proceeds towards a cause shared with your customers. But today’s highly-informed customers want more than that. They look for products that have been responsibly sourced, produced, packaged, and distributed.   2 – Products Serving The Value-Driven Customer: Another trend identified in the same IBM study is the rise of value-driven consumers. These consumers want the best value for their money and they look for convenience and good prices over anything else.   Again, this trend has shaped a new niche within every category. Every product with a mass-market ought to have an economical alternative that provides the best value for money.   Multiply Eyewear is an example of an eyewear brand that offers designer-quality sunglasses without the designer markup. They noticed the gap between cheap gas station sunglasses and the expensive $300 ones. The founders jumped in and filled the gap with their own eyewear brand. 3 – The Rising Niche of the Omni-Present Consumers: IBM also identified another trend shaping the eCommerce industry – the rise of the omnipresent consumer. Today’s customers are always online. They’re either hanging out on social, talking to friends on a messenger app, watching a video on YouTube, reading blogs, or browsing websites. The cool thing is, these customers want to be able to shop anywhere they want.   They don’t want to leave their social feed or abandon a video to buy something. They are looking for omnichannel shopping experiences in which they can buy anything, anywhere they want – even if it’s directly from a TikTok video they’re watching. This trend has shaped a niche market within every category. And since the trend is new, not many businesses are making the most of it, giving you the perfect opportunity to be the first that serves that omnipresent consumer.   If you’re starting a jewelry business, for example, you can probably be the first omnichannel jewelry shop by integrating all your social channels with your eCommerce store.   4 - Targeting Remote Workers: Though originally influenced by the pandemic, remote work is here to stay as determined by a PwC survey of 669 CEOs. Another recent study by Gartner found that 80% of company leaders are open to letting employees work from home.   This trend has shaped a whole new market and created a new category of business. Remote workers have their own unique problems and needs and not many businesses are specifically serving them. If you’re looking for a business idea, this is the perfect niche to be first in.   You can further niche down in this category by targeting the people in your local area or a specific group of remote workers like freelance writers.   5 - The Rise of PC Gamers: Another trend that’s really on fire these days is PC gaming. It got a major boost during the pandemic as people had more time to pursue their hobbies. But even as lockdowns are easing, the trend isn’t faltering anytime soon. The IDC has predicted that the demand for PC gaming products is likely to increase over the next four years.   Though PC gamers have been around forever, demand has only recently surged. Meaning there aren’t yet a lot of businesses that are specifically targeting PC gamers. And even if the larger market share is already taken by someone, there are bound to be some niche markets within the category where you can be the first in.   Conclusion: Today’s business landscape has become highly competitive. There is so much noise out there that it has become increasingly hard to get your prospects to pay attention. If there is a big audience out there and you try to talk to everyone, there is very little chance of having anyone pay attention to you. But if you select a small group of people – say people wearing red hats and yellow sweaters, and speak directly to them, there is very little chance of getting ignored.   That’s why targeting a niche market always works.

    "title": "How to Pick a Health Insurance Plan as a Freelancer",
    "body": "2021/12/07 - The gig economy has led to many advancements and breakthroughs in how the workforce operates. Freelance work allows workers to take ownership of their work, and demand a premium for their services, without being subjected to the whims of a company. But freelance work also comes with some extra headaches, like having to figure out your own retirement plan, how to schedule a workday and schedule, and choosing your own health insurance plan. There are a lot of insurance plans out there for freelancers, and choosing one can feel daunting, so here are a few tips to help you select the perfect insurance plan as a freelance worker.   Understand Your Costs: There are a lot of costs that come along with an insurance plan. From premiums to deductibles and other fees and charges, it can seem like each plan is designed as a never ending web of expenses that you need to stay on top of. It doesn’t have to be this complicated. Simply keep a check on deductibles and monthly costs for the insurance plans you are comparing. A deductible is the amount that you are expected to cover for a doctor’s visit or health care costs before your insurance takes over the rest. Your monthly fees are what you pay every month to maintain coverage. These are the major costs that you have on your plan and should be the uber one determinants on cost for you and your family.   Use an ACA Exchange: Thanks to the Affordable Care Act passed in the U. S. during the Obama years, there are now ACA exchanges in every state that help you compare individual and family health care plans that comply with the coverage rules and regulations of the Affordable Care Act. Using an ACA exchange will help you make sure that your plan that you select for yourself and/or your family is fully ACA compliant so as to avoid tax issues later in the year. ACA exchanges allow you to see and compare the plans and providers in your state offering individual plans so you always know what is available, what it covers, and what the costs are to you.   Consider a High-Deductible Plan: As discussed above, the two aspects of cost associated with a healthcare plan are the deductible and the monthly payment. The deductible is the cost that you are expected to pay out of pocket before your insurance comes in and helps cover the rest of the cost of your healthcare costs. There are plans that have high deductibles, aptly called high-deductible plans. These are a good idea to consider if you are a healthy, young person who does not have many or any prescription medication needs and who does not expect to incur large healthcare costs. These plans charge a significantly lower premium in exchange for asking for a much higher deductible for healthcare coverage that is not preventative in nature. These plans can save tons of money for people who do not have large health care costs.   Make Sure You Have Specialist Coverage: Every plan is different in what it covers and what it does not cover. One of the most common differences in coverage across health care plans is what specialist care they cover and what they do not. Healthcare plans should provide specialized care such as dermatology services. You should also prioritize plans that cover mental health, chiropractic services, and any other specialist service that you might need, so that you don’t end up in the position of needing specialist care that is not covered by your health insurance plan. You can find all of this information in the plan breakdowns that are available online, just make sure to do your research and find plans that cover what you need. Make Sure to Get Your Subsidies: The Affordable Care Act mandates that most Americans get and maintain active health insurance plans, but the Affordable Care Act also offers tax credits for individuals who provide their own insurance, like freelancers. So, while the premiums for many plans can cost a few hundred dollars a month, the average American pays only $106 per month after the tax credits apply. Any individual or family that earns less than 400% of the poverty line ($47,520 or $97,200 respectively) qualifies for the subsidies If you are a freelancer that falls within this category, then you should make sure that you get your subsidies from purchasing a plan that is on the exchanges, it could save you thousands of dollars per year.   Don’t Skimp on a Short-Term Healthcare Plan: There are plans known as short-term healthcare plans that are available from insurers not offered on the government or state exchanges that offer ACA compliant plans. These plans offer significantly lower premiums than traditional longer term insurance plans. But these short-term plans have terrible drawbacks. First, they are not ACA compliant, so they can discriminate against those with preexisting conditions, or not cover preventive care or prescription drugs, and cap your total benefits. These plans also do not legally count as insurance, meaning that you will still be subject to the tax penalty for not having insurance. Whatever savings these plans seem to offer, they will end up costing you much more money in the long run.   Consider Bronze Plans or Catastrophic Plans: The usual tax credit applications for insurance coverage are calculated based on the cost of a silver plan – the middle tier of plans available through the exchanges. But there are plans that cover less – sometimes a lot less – for much lower monthly premiums. The skimpiest of plans are called catastrophic plans, that are great for young people (you must be 30 or younger to qualify) who are healthy, as it covers a few primary care visits and preventive services, and not much else. This leaves you a huge deductible, but if you aren’t expecting to have major healthcare costs, this can save you money. There are also bronze plans, which are a step above catastrophic plans, and cover around 60% of costs. Both of these plans still offer tax credits, just not as many as a silver plan. These plans can save you a ton of money if you are young and healthy.   Make Sure You Hit the Deadline: One of the drawbacks of the ACA is that you can now only enroll in healthcare plans through the exchange during a limited window of time. This is meant to discourage people from waiting to buy health insurance only once they have gotten sick. This means that you typically only have a few  months of the year , from November through the end of January, to sign up. Make sure you don’t miss the deadline, or you can be hit with major tax penalties in April. There are exceptions for “qualifying life events” that can qualify you to sign up at other times during the year, but don’t bank on these exceptions.   Getting a health insurance plan as a freelancer is far from easy. But thanks to changes to the health insurance market in recent years, it has helped to centralize some of the decisions. Follow these eight pieces of advice, and you will be prepared to choose the best insurance plan for you. Want to start your 6-figure business? Get my top secrets here! "

If you feel like you already have a specific audience, try to get more specific. Specificity in your target demographic can be scary for many business owners, as they fear it will limit their potential growth, but the truth is the opposite. Targeting the group or groups that have the most interest in what you do will help to grow your recognition and presence among the people that are most likely to purchase and come back.

Pitch Articles to Publications: With a little bit of research and some original thoughts, you can pitch article ideas to journals or magazines.

    "body": "2021/11/09 - Hiring qualified, dedicated, and hardworking employees is a major headache. Not only that, but it is also rather expensive - you have to hire recruiters and hiring experts, go through interviews, maybe even offering starting bonuses to get people in the door. it all adds up. Which is why keeping employee turnover low is essential to keep your business costs low. Here are some ways to keep your business turnover low.   Make Your Business a Great Place to Work: Not all work places are enjoyable places to work, so employees often don’t want to leave a great workplace. But making your business a great place to work isn’t always as simple as you want it to be.   A couple things you can do to make your workplace a good space to work are offering fair compensation and benefits, bonuses, and doing fun activities as a team. You can also have strong values that your company acts on, which makes employees feel like they are doing something that is benefiting the greater world.   Build Up Your Employees: In order to keep your employees happy and feeling seen, you need to recognize their efforts and success. Employee recognition helps attract and retain quality talent at your business. People like receiving credit for work well done, and the better you are able to publicly and clearly congratulate and reward good work, the more everyone is going to want to do good work.   Giving recognition helps employees feel like they are seen and valued - and people don’t often leave workplaces that make them feel valued. Try giving awards, bonuses, and verbal and written congratulations when employees go above and beyond.    Listen and Act on Complaints and Suggestions: A lot of companies will listen to employee complaints. But very few ever act on those complaints and suggestions. Making your employees feel heard is great, but they will feel seen and valued when you act on what you have heard.   Employees that can affect real change in their workspace will make sure that the workspace remains a place they want to work. This will cut turnover drastically, as fixing the things people don’t like will eliminate things they don’t like. It’s as simple as that.   Employee turnover is no fun. It is time consuming and costly. But with a little creativity, sensitivity, and effort, you can avoid turnover by making sure your employees feel valued and important.

According to Franchise Gator, you can use your 401(k) assets to fund a new business if you have at least $50,000 saved up in it.   Finding investors and looking into small business loans you qualify for are alternative methods that many small businesses have used successfully in the past. You can even utilize credit cards depending on the scope! Make Your Business Legitimate: Before your business actually opens for business, you need to make it legitimate. During this step, Nav recommends you pick out a business name that is unique and differentiates you from other businesses. You also should pick an address and phone number, register your business name, and create your business entity before you open its doors.

Practicing also entails making an agenda for your meeting to stay on track and cover all your desired material.   Find a Meeting Space : Your meeting space will depend on the nature of the meeting and level of formality you wish to have with your prospective client. If you run your business from home and don’t have a great meeting spot, consider meeting at a café or virtual office space. Virtual offices can be a great cost-saving measure if you only need an office on occasion. Whichever space you choose, make sure the environment is not distracting and it aligns with the values of your client.   Personal Presentation : Your appearance greatly impacts a potential client’s perception of you. When you dress professionally, you show respect for your business, your products, your services, and of course your clients. Dress to impress your clients, but to match the occasion that you are meeting them under. Make sure your personal hygiene is thought of; your hair and nails well-groomed and breath not offensive. Your posture will also impact the presentation. Stand up straight, confident, and relaxed. Ultimately, you want to come off as the best version of yourself: professional but relatable, confident, and competent.   Part of making a good impression for your clients is presenting yourself in a pleasing light. You must also find a good place where you can meet and discuss business details. Most importantly, you must demonstrate to your client that you know their business and they can trust you.

    "body": "2021/09/21 - Working remotely as a manager can be a challenge. You may be unsure how to help your team members or don’t know who is working on what project. However, if you follow the tips below, you can become the successful remote work manager you aspire to be. Stay in Frequent Communication: Frequent check-ins on how your team members are doing can help you manage projects and them stay on task. The check-in doesn’t have to be anything lengthy either. You can simply send them a quick message to see how they’re doing or ask how their projects are coming along. Knowing what issues will arise from projects throughout the process rather than when they are due can be a lifesaver. Many people use applications like Trello to keep up with what their remote team are up to. You could also use email, texts, or Zoom to get a quick update. By staying in touch with your team members, you can help them accomplish their job to its fullest.   Conduct Performance Reviews: To keep your team members motivated and accountable, you can set up monthly or yearly performance reviews. During a performance review, you’d meet one-on-one over the phone or video chat to discuss how your team member is doing. You can manage your expectations of that team member by laying out the specific tasks you’d like them doing each day.   Be sure to set up goals together to keep your team motivated. You could consider offering a raise as an incentive for a team member who is performing exceptionally well. Recognizing team members can lead to higher engagement in your business. If a team member isn’t matching the expectations you set, you can address this issue during the performance reviews. Many remote entrepreneurs give their team members a warning if they aren’t performing well. Then they give the team member a set deadline to try again and improve at their tasks. If the team member is still not matching expectations, you can let them go. Be Supportive: When you notice a team member who is lacking motivation, be there to support them. Having a supportive, empathetic manager to be there to listen can help remote workers. If they feel like you’re on their side, they will likely work for you longer and be able to handle their current workload.   If your team members are afraid to speak up about uncomfortable topics or issues, send them an anonymous, online survey. Get feedback on how you can improve as a manager. If your team is struggling with something or someone, address the issue carefully and thoughtfully. The main takeaway is to truly listen to your team. Communicate with them often on their projects and listen to any concerns they have. Then address them. If you treat your team members how they want to be treated, then they’ll love working with you. Ready to start your consulting business? Grab my book to get started today! "

    "title": "Skills That Come in Handy for Every Entrepreneur",
    "body": "2021/09/16 - So you want to be an entrepreneur! The fact is, whether you’ve already started a business or are preparing to, this line of work requires you to develop a large variety of skills. Entrepreneurs can’t just be good marketers or product developers–they should be excellent in every facet of running a business. If you’re wondering what other skills to gain to better your current or future business, here are a few that come in most handy! Networking: No matter how successful you are on your own as an entrepreneur, you can’t do everything by yourself. Networking is an essential skill that you need to learn, whether you call yourself an extrovert or an introvert. People in your industry or related fields can give you advice about entrepreneurship, provide support, and even partner with you in certain business ventures. In the beginning of your entrepreneur path, your network can also help you find a mentor to look over your business plan and provide advice throughout its startup stages. Plus, the more people you know, the more likely they’ll think of you when a business opportunity becomes available! Writing: With some business skills, you can hire others or even outsource to get the most quality work. However, writing is a proficiency you need to develop early on and continue to foster as your business grows. More than ever, writing is an essential part of communication. Considering professional communication with your employees, partners, and clients is largely dependent on how well you write, it can make or break a business–and that’s not even covering all the documentation, contracts, marketing content, and stakeholder correspondence you’ll be writing along the way. To improve your writing, it can be helpful to do a lot of reading in the areas you intend to write. Look for different patterns that you can employ in related situations, and even read advice about business writing. Negotiation: There are many instances where you will need to negotiate with others. This can include negotiating with partners, suppliers, or your clients. The power of negotiation is that it allows you to get what you need out of pricing, payment terms, service contracts, investor’s exit strategy, and more while also maintaining a positive relationship with the other party. One piece of advice to always remember: leave your emotions at the door. You can’t negotiate well with anger or annoyance, but by sticking to the facts of the situation. It’s also important for you to learn how to see things from other people’s perspectives. This will allow you to understand them better and see how the two of you can reach a perfect compromise that both parties favor. Tech Savvy: In today’s business world, technology is involved in almost every process. You can’t run your business solely on pen and paper, and that’s a good thing! Many tasks have been automated or improved by technology, and it has widely improved marketing. For that reason, every small business owner should learn the basics of making a quality website and how to market through various social media platforms. It is important for you to learn how to effectively use various types of technology in order to avoid large expenses and wasted time. Because technology plays such a big role, however, outside help is still better than DIY-ing without any expertise. For instance, you can reduce down periods by outsourcing your IT issues to outside experts, or hire a freelance professional to design your website. If you don’t know what is high quality yourself, however, you could still end up paying for bad or overpriced work. Leadership: Of all the skills an entrepreneur needs, it is most essential that you hone your leadership skills. After all, when running your own business, all responsibility falls on you. One of the best ways to be a good leader and inspire others is by having good communication. The best leaders know they’re not usually the smartest person in the room, but can adapt easily and recognize others’ great ideas. This includes listening to your staff, clients, and business partners even when there is criticism or opposing ideas to your own. Along with this, organization is another essential leadership skill, in organizing people, ideas, priorities, operations, and actual materials. The better you can manage things and people, the more you can act as glue to hold together all the amazing single pieces of an organization. Client Relations: A major part of your business is driven by your clients. Without them, you won’t even have a business. For that reason, you need to employ excellent client relations skills. Educate yourself on the best methods of designing client experience and improving it. When their experience with your business is subpar, then you need to know how to address the situation, improve in the future, and retain a good relationship. This is important because, especially as you get started, a lot of the responsibilities surrounding client relations will fall on you. Marketing: If you want to be successful, then of course you need to let people know about your business. Marketing should be one of your main priorities, especially in the beginning of your business. There are many strategies you can employ, but unfortunately, there’s no perfect way of marketing you could steal from another business. On the other hand, you can study and take note of how businesses in your industry with similar circumstances and size have succeeded themselves. You can also research the target market you should be focusing your marketing on, including their demographics and psychographics. And then, of course, you should also learn the different marketing strategies people use depending on the channel of marketing, such as a business website, social media, SEO, and PPA methods. Financial Skills: As an entrepreneur, the financial aspect of your business is something you should learn well. Finances can be difficult to navigate and mistakes are easily made. Additionally, if you don’t understand the finances within your business, you can end up spending more than you can afford without making a sustainable profit. Research how to handle your finances and navigate small business loans, if necessary. Eventually, it might be a good idea to outsource your accounting to be sure that everything is done properly. There are so many skills expected of an entrepreneur, not to mention responsibilities. While mastering these skills takes time, learning them early on will help propel your business towards success.

    "body": "2021/08/31 - Starting a company is an exciting thing that comes with many opportunities and benefits for you as a person and as an entrepreneur. Unfortunately, all of those benefits come along with some pretty big expenses, and that can be intimidating and frustrating for many entrepreneurs. Figuring out how to keep your costs low is one of the most beneficial things you can do for your business to make sure that it is as successful as possible. From your budget to planning out the time you spend researching costs, there are many things you can do to make sure that your business can operate as efficiently and cost-effectively as possible.   Create a Budget: The very most important thing you can do to help your costs stay low is to make sure that you have things planned out from the beginning. Create a budget for your business and do what you can to stick to it whenever possible. Sometimes unexpected expenses will sneak through, but in general you want to make sure that your budget is solid and that you are able to do the things you need to do for the costs you anticipated. Budget in a little bit of extra money so you know that you are covered if an emergency comes up.   Scale Appropriately: When your business is just getting started it’s easy to get excited about the things you have coming your way. That can sometimes cause entrepreneurs to start things out on too big of a scale or attempt to grow their business too quickly. This is expensive and can be disastrous especially if you vastly overestimate your needs. It’s better to start conservatively so that you can cover your needs and grow as it becomes necessary. It can be hard to figure out the exact right scale to work at, so it’s best to do a lot of research and stay on the ball so you can adapt as you need to.   Keep It Simple: You also don’t want to start your business with every idea you’ve ever had all at once. The more complex your business plan is, the more expenses you will need to take care of and the harder it will be on your budget. Start slow and keep things simple so that you can control things easily and keep your expenses at a reasonable level. Keeping it simple can apply to how many kinds of products you sell at first, your web design, and even your hiring decisions. As you master one aspect of your business, you can start adding more elements and building in more complexity.   Control Inventory: You may think that purchasing or creating a huge amount of inventory up front is a good strategy, but it can end up costing you too much too quickly. Starting with a reasonable amount of inventory and increasing it as demand increases is the best way to ensure your bases are covered without overspending. There are many things you can do to minimize excess inventory when you are getting things up and running. Especially when you first start out, print-on-demand is a great way to avoid some of the larger costs of inventory. With tricks like this you can make sure you are meeting the demand without over purchasing and overspending.   Make Smart Hiring Decisions: Hiring is one of the most important elements of running any business, but it is important that you make sure to do it in a smart way. In the early days of your business, you want to make sure you have enough help to get things done without being overwhelmed, but you also don’t want to hire more employees than you can afford. It’s also important to hire people with the skills to help your business be as successful as possible. Be smart about your hiring decisions from the beginning so you can keep a reasonable staff, stay busy, and avoid overworking anyone on your team.   Outsource When Necessary: It can be tempting to try to take care of every task in house, but that isn’t always the smartest or the cheapest way to get things done. If you have small tasks that your team doesn’t have the skill or time for, outsourcing may be the best thing you can do to keep your business running. This can apply to things like web design or other projects. Working with experts can give you access to a high level of quality for a smaller expense than hiring someone full time when you don’t have a full-time workload to offer them. You should assess each project on an individual basis, so you can make the best possible decision as to whether to outsource or make an in-house hire.   Carefully Consider Office Space Needs: Figuring out how much space to rent is another big decision that can profoundly impact your budget. When you are getting your business started, you want to rent out as little office space as you can while still getting the job done. This is because office space is expensive and renting too much can cost you in the long run. If you do need to rent a larger space and have extra room, subletting can be a good way to get a little more room in your budget to take care of your other business needs. Take time to figure out how much space you need so that you can make sure your business has what it needs without overextending on rent costs.   Shop Around for Supplies and Equipment: Every business needs some supplies and equipment to work properly, but you don’t have to take those costs at face value. By shopping around, you can find the best possible rates and make sure that you keep your budget buttoned down tight. Sometimes you can even secure discounts by making multiple purchases through the same vendor or signing up for a subscription. The most important thing is that you make sure you check a variety of vendors so you can get the best possible deal. Even small price differences can add up to huge benefits if you are getting the same or a better level of quality.   Use Tax Deductions: With all the expenses you incur as a business owner, it can feel overwhelming. Luckily many of those expenses can be mitigated at least somewhat by deductions when you pay your taxes. While these deductions won’t come until after the fact, they can still help you in a big way and it is important to make sure you take advantage of every deduction you qualify for. Doing your taxes for the first time as a business owner can be challenging, so if you are feeling overwhelmed, hiring an accountant can actually help you to save money in addition to lowering your stress levels.   If you have the opportunity to start your own business, you are at an exciting point of your life. By managing your budget as effectively as possible you can ensure your success and start turning a profit sooner rather than later. Managing the finances of a business is both difficult and rewarding, so it is worth taking the time to do it right from the very beginning. Want to start your 6-figure business?

    "body": "2021/08/24 - Generating better leads for your business can take a lot of work and thought. While you may think the most effective results are singularly through advertising efforts, this isn’t necessarily true. You can find better leads in more practical ways without needing to spend a ton on advertising.  Here’s how you can do it! Rely on Current Customers: First, you should talk with your customers and see what they like about your brand. What do they like about your product? What problems are they thankful that it solves? This can give you a better idea of who you should be marketing to in the first place. You shouldn’t shy away from asking for referrals and advice from your customers as well. Incentives for referral-focused customers (such as coupons or free visits) are an excellent way to find new people all the time! Your customers will know people who also struggle with the same issues they do, and asking them to pass on your information can offer fruitful results. Create a Sales Funnel: You should always be trying to get potential customers into the “sales funnel. ” This process may sound super official, but it is actually multiple different casual events that lead up to a loyal customer. In order to be considered a prospect, a potential customer must fall within your target audience. The next step is to contact your customer. This can be a simple initial contact that revolves around smiling and kindness. As their interest is piqued over time, you can extend an offer to them. Resolve their concerns, and then you can close the sale! Make sure you are always taking people through this funnel. Attend Networking Events: Another solid way at getting brand-new contacts is through networking. While it may seem like events like this are stuck because of the pandemic, you can still attend virtual networking events to meet new businesses and attempt to strike a deal with them. B2B marketing is an effective way to cement your position in the local community and can keep your business alive. Even if you aren’t able to attend an event, never stop finding ways to network with those around you. Bring a business card with you wherever you go. All in all, your ability to lock down future clients will highly depend on your foresight. Don’t take anything for granted, and always be on the lookout for the next potential customer. It’s the way to keep your company afloat through everything.   Find out my best secrets to business success in my book! "

But while there are so many things demanding your time, be sure to prioritize improving your business image. Applying some of these suggestions can make a big difference in the perceived professionalism of your startup. Get a Professional Website: Getting a professional website is one of the biggest steps towards taking your startup to the next level. As you think about getting a professional website, do adequate research about things like your domain name. domains can be incredibly expensive—sometimes thousands of dollars. And once you’ve picked your domain name, it’s difficult to change it. So invest time and thought in what you want your website to really be and embody. Find Office Space: Next, finding office space for your business will help you take things to the next level. But sometimes, the costs of having a brick-and-mortar location can be incredibly high in comparison to the benefits. If this is your situation, be willing to think about some of the other more creative options available to you. For example, coworking spaces give you access to a business address and meeting rooms without the commitment of an office. This will seriously minimize costs and help you still have the benefits of a physical location for things like meetings. Additionally, having your address listed on your Google page will help boost your page in its algorithm for related searches. Refine Your Brand Design: Another important step to consider when trying to take your startup to the next level is the quality of the brand design and graphic design you have for things like your logo. Your logo acts as the symbol that will mark your image, your products, and your company. If you’ve simply thrown it together without the help of a professional graphic designer, you might be missing out. Having a professional help you better develop your brand will ensure that you give off strong professional first impressions. Giving off a professional and trustworthy impression is essential for new businesses, especially because you have so few reviews for prospective customers to consider.

    "body": "2021/08/03 - Whether you are a small business owner, a freelancer, a professional in a huge enterprise, or anything in between, you will definitely face the need to compose emails – lots of them. Consider all the individuals you may need to communicate with and with whom you will want a record of those communications:  Internal emails to team members regarding projects and project completion Internal emails to superiors to report progress, to request resources, and to address any other issues that may be affecting the organization  External emails to clients and potential clients Newsletters  Welcome emails to new customers or subscribers Emails to current clients or customers to announce new product or service lines and special offers Formal proposals  Progress reports to clients regarding projects Contracts with new customers/clients for their review and approval MoreJust How Important are Emails to Your Business Success? The short answer is that they are critical.    Your reputation as a professional is affected by the emails you compose and send to others The content of your emails can engage, compel, persuade, make a case, provide instructions, educate, or inspire, depending upon your ability to craft them well.  Emails provide a clear record of communication with others, without the need for paper files – they are simply more efficient Emails are convenient – they can be sent by or received on any device, no matter where sender or recipient may physically be While messaging apps may be even more convenient, they are limited in scope and cannot include the detail that an email can. Messaging is for very short communications. Emails have more “meat. ”Given all of this, it is probably time that you evaluate your email composition with an eye to improving its effectiveness.   Here are eight tips to do just that. As you read through them, conduct your own self-evaluation. Short and Sweet There is an old saying: “If I ask you what time it is, do not tell me how to make a watch. ” The point is clear. When you send an email, it should contain all necessary information but nothing more. Think about your recipients. They want you to be respectful of their time, and they do not want to pour through irrelevant and unnecessary “fluff. ”  The best remedy for getting too wordy and off-track is to make a pointed list of what needs to be in the email before you ever compose it. Put the points in the order you want to make them, and then write that short and sweet email.   Make the Subject line Count So many people just breeze through their emails, even from business associates or companies they have done business with. If you want your email opened and read, then your subject line must be compelling and perhaps even a bit creatively written. Think of your subject line as a headline a journalist might write, especially if you are announcing something – a new product or service, a special offer, etc. If you have a tough time creating such subject lines, get in touch with EssayPro, a professional writing service with an entire department of creative writers/journalists who can come up with great subject lines for your emails. And never skip a subject line, even if you and the recipient email one another every day. It’s easy to scroll through emails that lack a subject line. Be Very Specific with Your Content You have listed the points you are going to make. Now, do not “water down” those points with vague rhetoric. Each point you make must be very specific, so there is no confusion or question about what you are saying. Re-read your email several times and be certain that you have not been vague or too general in any of the points you are making. If you are not clear with instructions, moving forward with something, etc. then the recipient will have to take the time to get back to you for clarification. It’s irritating, and it eats up your time too. Insert a Call to Action When Appropriate If you need a response, say so at the end of your email. For example, if you need additional resources to complete a project, ask for them and ask for a response to your request as soon as possible. If you have to revise a project you are completing for a client, then ask that client to review the revision and provide a timeframe to get back to you with their approval.   If you are announcing a new product or service, ask your recipient to get back to you if they have questions or need more detail. Newsletters may not need a call to action, unless you are making an offer and including a deadline, perhaps tying that offer to completion of a survey, etc. Stay with Simple Language It’s easy to want to sound very professional, and that can lead to the use of niche-related jargon as well as complex/compound sentences that readers will have to wade through, in order to get the real meaning. If you worry that your emails are too sophisticated, use a tool to check the reading level that will also make suggestions for simplifying what you are saying. Grammarly and Hemingway Editor are two good ones. Find the Balance Between Stiffness and Casualness You have lots of different types of recipients. And your tone and style will vary based upon your relationship with them. You may want to be a bit more formal with a proposal to a new client than you would be with the one you have done business with for a long time.   At the same time, as a society, we have become far more casual in our business communication, and that is a good thing. You will need to find the right balance for you and for your audiences. About Those Attachments This is an ideal way to provide the detail that you don’t want in your email content. And attachments can also be critical – proposals, contracts for signing, and such. NEVER fail to point your recipient to any attachment that you have included in the email. Often, those attachments are the real “meat” of what you want to achieve by this email. Always Proofread Never hit the “send” button unless you have proofread your email. In fact, read through it at least three times. Are the sentences correct? Are there any spelling or grammatical errors? Does anything sound awkward? And this includes any attachments too. You never know the peculiarities of your recipients. They may be sticklers on grammar, vocabulary, spelling, and even punctuation. When they see errors, they can become irritated and certainly think a bit less of you. Your reputation is not worth making compositional errors. If you are not a skilled grammarian, find a source that is and use it. The Wrap Email communication is not going away. It is a mainstay of business communication of all types. You may be using it for a wide variety of purposes and for very diverse audiences. But these eight tips are universal. They will ensure that your emails are opened, read, understood, and acted upon as you need. Evaluate your own email communication against these tips and “if the shoe fits, wear it. ” [author] [author_image timthumb=’on’]https://katebagoy. com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/headshot. jpg[/author_image] [author_info]Jessica Fender is a copywriter and blogger with a background in marketing and sales.

    "title": "What Are My Options for Selling Online?",
    "body": "2021/07/29 - If you are a small business owner, entrepreneur, or freelancer, you’re probably wondering how to sell products online successfully. It can be tricky to know how to make a significant profit while maneuvering the challenges of online marketing. Here are a few different options for selling your products online and how to make a sizable profit. Use a Marketplace: One great way you can advertise and sell your products is by using a marketplace like Etsy or Facebook, Instagram Shopping, or Facebook Marketplace. These marketplace sites can be advantageous because your company can gain lots of followers and create content that is visually appealing for your followers. Especially if you are interested in crafting or creative products, you may want to try Etsy, which is a gathering place for creators, crafters, and lovers of DIY projects. The search features on these sites allow your potential customers to browse different products that they’re interested in without needing to know the name or website of your company previously. Create a Website: One of the most important things that you can do to be successful in online sales and marketing is creating a website. You can do so by hiring a website coder or using a website template that you can find online (we use Divi for Wordpress). When creating your website, you want to make sure that it will be easy to find when people are searching on the internet. Try to use simple and straightforward URLs that are easy to remember and transparent in their nature. In your website descriptions and content, use keywords that are related to your services and products. This will help your company to come up as one of the first options when potential customers search for products. If you choose to create an eCommerce website, make sure you have it properly set up to take orders.   Make sure that you have safe and secure transaction technology since this will encourage customers to buy products from your website. Social Media: Since websites aren’t exactly social media platforms, you’ll want to run social media pages for your business to gain greater visibility. One of the best ways to improve your online sales is to post regularly on social media such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram and try to increase your following. The more people that are following your accounts and seeing the products you are posting, the more sales your business will have. To increase your following, try posting behind-the-scenes videos or reels with lifestyle or care tips that relate to the products that you sell. These kinds of posts can be very interesting for your followers and can reach other individuals that don’t already follow your account. The more people that follow and view your social media pages, the more people will buy your products. Have an Attractive Aesthetic: Before your website is live online, you’ll want to make sure that it is attractive to your viewers and customers. The overall color scheme and aesthetic should be stylish, following the current trends in online marketing sites. Your site should be easy to maneuver, with a clear menu and direct instructions. Include simple descriptions of each of your products so customers know important details about the products they want to purchase. You’ll also want to make sure that you include updated and attractive product photos since photos are enticing for customers. These details will help your site to be easy to maneuver so that your customers won’t get frustrated using it and will be persuaded to buy your products. Clear Communication Lines: In order to have an eCommerce site, you need to maintain clear and facilitated communication with your customers through different features. You’ll want to make sure that your contact information can be easily found on your social media or website so that your customers can easily contact you if they have questions about a product or need help. You can even consider setting up a live customer service chat or using your direct messages to facilitate communication lines. If you can resolve customer concerns quickly, they’ll be more likely to be loyal to your company and continue buying your products, which is why clear communication lines are so important. Get Rid of Issues: There are a lot of issues or annoyances that can turn off online shoppers from buying products. If your social media page has excessive ads or your website has lots of popups that are distracting and annoying, your potential customers probably won’t ever make it to buying something from your company. Another issue for many customers is additional surprise costs like shipping. Many customers are willing to pay the price for certain products but don’t want to follow through with their purchase when they see that taxes and shipping will be tacked onto the price at the end. If possible, try to run sales or offer free shipping on your products so customers are encouraged to buy your products. As you are preparing to sell your products online, review these different selling options and figure out what will work best for the products that you are trying to sell. Remember that making the customer’s experience enjoyable is one of the best ways to increase your sales. As you market your website, products, and services to the interests of your audience, your online sales will become very successful. To know more about my best business tips, check out my book! "

    "body": "2021/07/20 - https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=jKY2WSjAdR4 The success and growth rates you experience directly correlate with what you invest in your business. It is uncommon for a freelancer to have unlimited resources for their business, which makes it crucial for them to keep track of their expenses along the way. As a freelancer, don’t neglect to track equipment investments, client communication costs, and health insurance. Equipment Investments: Equipment is a necessary part of running any business. Even the simplest attributes like having a facility with running water play a role in your production process. Working from an extra bedroom in your home still qualifies as a use of equipment. Computers, cell phones, machinery, office supplies, etc. also contribute to your equipment costs. These costs can be tax-deductible expenses for freelancers. Rather than calculating just how much it takes to produce your product, be sure to include all associated costs for a better investment estimate. Client Communication Costs: Communication is vital to the success of a business and cannot be done well without the proper resources. There are costs associated with the communication you have with your clientele. These would include postal services, phone plans, internet availability, and so forth. Fortunately, there are various package options that let you bundle your expenses and reduce costs. There are also several emerging technologies that make it possible to network and communicate better with your customers. Search for the latest strategies and technologies to help you run client communication more efficiently. Health Insurance: Health insurance including medical, dental, or long-term care is incredibly valuable. You never know when something could happen to you or your loved ones that prevent you from being able to earn an income or cover the cost of the bills. Investing in health insurance is investing in the safety of you and your business for years to come. If you are self-employed, there is a major tax deduction you can take from providing your own medical insurance premiums. This is only available if you have a net profit from self-employment. To claim this deduction, you’ll find it on Line 1 of Schedule A form 1040. As a freelancer, responsibility for everything is all on you. This can be stressful, especially for those starting out. The key to success is to focus on the basics and doing them well. Three basic expenses to keep in mind: equipment, communication, insurance. For more of my best business tips, check out my book!   "

    "body": "2021/07/12 - There are many tried and true methods for appealing to your audience through content. However, it might be time to try a new form of content creation. Audiences enjoy variety and their preference for consuming information and entertainment change over time. Video Content: For many people, videos are their preferred method of learning and being entertained. For people with busy and fast-paced lives, video content is ideal. It doesn’t take as much effort to engage with the content, and it is delivered quickly. Additionally, videos allow people to make more of a connection with you and your message. You can demonstrate your personality, which draws people in more. You can also portray more emotion than in a written message. Video content is also very convenient. Aside from being easy to consume, it also works well across multiple formats. Using video content for your business is the right move. Podcasts: Many businesses have turned to creating podcasts. Much like videos, podcasts are easy for consumers to access. More than 70 percent of people say they listen to podcasts to learn new things. It is very common for people to turn on a podcast while commuting, cleaning, working, etc. All they need to do is listen. The benefit of having a podcast for your business is it allows you to regularly engage with your audience. A lot of businesses will have weekly episodes on their podcast. This allows you to increase your exposure to your current audience and reach out to a wider audience. If people like what they hear, they will come back for more and they will recommend your podcast to others as well. Social Media: Social media is commonly used by businesses for marketing purposes.

    "body": "2021/06/22 - The most important thing a business can do is be focused on its clientele and building client trust. Without customer support, your business is as good as done. If you want your company to be successful, you must think about how you currently interact with the consumer or client, and how to develop their trust. It’s harder than it looks, but any business is capable of it! Deliver a Tailored Product: First, your clients have to trust that you’ve got the goods. A worthwhile product will likely convince people that your business is worth the effort all on its own. However, you shouldn’t be afraid to find new ways of customization so that anybody can understand and enjoy your product. It’s especially wise to develop a marketing strategy with a target audience in mind. Your key demographics will enable you to experiment with different ad campaigns, and may spark your innovative mindset when developing new products. Listen to client feedback—they can give pointers and create a “Wishlist” of things they want your product to do. Follow Up: Another way to gain more support from clients is by following up. Most people aren’t thinking about how cool your product is throughout the day, but they likely have had positive experiences with it. Reaching out to these past clients can be a great way to evaluate how you are doing. If you simply ask your clients, 60% are likely to leave a review. Using a marketing tool like MailChimp can help you send follow up emails that don’t bother them too much. Be sure that you don’t send emails too frequently, otherwise people will get annoyed with you. Be Friendly: Kindness is key. While the other two are practical strategies that take time and conscious effort, being nice is something you can always do. Business is tricky, and occasionally you’ll find yourself in a tough spot. However, if you have a positive attitude and talk to each client as a friend, they will likely give your business more credit. Bad client-employee interactions can sour someone’s view of your company forever. For this reason, you must make sure to train every new employee on client interactions. It doesn’t cost anything, but it goes a long way. Developing better relationships with your client is essential for any productive company. Make sure that you follow up regularly, listen to your audience, and always remain friendly. These will help you find more clients and retain your old ones. But don’t worry, they are all in your control. Help build your business more with the tips and tricks in my book! "

    "body": "2021/06/17 - Whatever business you may be in, it’s important to know how to be a good leader. If you’re a good leader, you can grow your business and work well with your employees. Take some time to learn how you can become a better leader. Be Willing to Learn: A good leader is not someone who has learned everything there is to learn. Being a leader means you are continually learning as you go. There is always something you can change or improve, including your own attitudes. To be an effective leader, you need to be willing to learn. Your focus should be on how you can grow as a leader and how that growth can improve your business. Some ways you can show your willingness to learn are listening to feedback, taking time to reflect, and making changes as you continue to learn.   Put Your Employees First: Being a leader is not about you. It’s about the people you are leading. Your employees should be your first priority. This can mean many things. For example, putting your employees first can mean learning about them, understanding what encourages them to work well, and what type of feedback they respond to. It can also mean looking out for their wellbeing. You actually have a legal and ethical responsibility to take care of your employees at the workplace. Make sure you are following safety standards throughout your workplace. You should also find ways to provide for your employees’ needs. For example, offering your employees breaks throughout the day can allow them to recover from work and encourage them to do their jobs well. Improve Your Communication: There are many ways to become a good leader, but one of the best methods to follow is improving your communication. People are more willing to work for someone who communicates well. This means someone who thoroughly and accurately explains their expectations to their employees. It also means someone who actively listens to others. You need to create two-way communication within your business and that starts with you improving your own communication. In order to effectively grow your business and improve your workplace culture, you should do your best to become a better leader. Take time to consider what it means to you to be a good leader and consider asking your employees what they expect from you. Make a genuine effort to improve your leadership skills and see how it impacts your business. Ready to start your consulting business? Grab my book to get started today! "

    "title": "Guest Post- How to Build Brand Trust With Transparency: Top Tips",
    "body": "2021/06/15 - Look, every business owner knows that trust and loyalty are super valuable in customer-relationships. An eCommerce business selling books, like Book of Ra kostenlos, needs trust to build customer loyalty. Failing to do so makes it impossible to keep long-term customers on board. If a company is not clear about its intentions and business methods, people will go to the more open competitors. To avoid this situation, you need to make transparency the primary strategy in your business practices. Let’s take a look at how it works in practice.   What Does It Take to Maintain Brand Transparency in Business (and Build Trust): Every company can benefit immensely from having a presence on social media. In 2020, there were over 3 billion people all over the world using various social media sites. Pages like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube allow you to reach your target audience every day via ads and other social media posts. Customers have gotten so used to hearing from their favorite brands via Facebook feeds that they’re not likely to trust a company with zero social media presence. Even a simple Facebook page makes a business instantly more approachable and therefore trustworthy. People can use it to find brand information and ask questions. But there are many approaches to building a social media presence. What is the most efficient way of building brand trust via social media? First and foremost, a business needs to let the public know about how they run the business.   It involves the following steps:  Asking for honest customer feedback that you can post on your social media page. That lets the customers know that you value honesty.  Giving honest answers to even the most sensitive questions. One of the primary issues that consumers have with online businesses is the safety of their credit card details and other personal data. No matter what your policies are, it’s good to be open about them.  Sharing stories about how the business started. It is an effective strategy that not only builds transparency but also humanizes your brand. And guess what? People buy more from brands that share relatable human stories.  Showing how the products get made. Maybe your customers are eco-conscious. You’ll gain their loyalty if your product-making process is in tune with eco-friendliness.   Clarity of your Website: Trustworthy brands are excellent in keeping their websites as direct and easy to use as possible. That means eliminating all distractions. The first page of your website should be only a link to the customer area. If you feel like that’s too minimalistic, just put yourself in the shoes of a customer for a second. When they first come to your page, they don’t want to see a lot of distracting information. All they need is a strong argument for why your brand products are necessary. Another thing you need to be absolutely clear about is your prices. If there are high transportation fees to a client’s location, don’t let your customers know that only a click away from the purchase. That only increases the shopping cart abandonment rate. Instead, let the customer know about all the fees as soon as possible.   Openness With Reviews: You’ve probably noticed that Google search features customer reviews. That means that having customer reviews on your website is essential for your SEO strategy. But what if some customer reviews are negative? Wouldn’t it scare away possible clients? The answer is no. Companies should not fear the backlash of negative reviews. Think about it this way: even if some of the reviews are negative, displaying them shows your readiness to address customer concerns. Everybody makes mistakes. Some products may be faulty. Or some days your services are unable to produce the desired results. But you can build life-long relationships with customers only if you’re honest about your errors and do everything you can to make them good. This kind of transparent attitude builds trust with people.     Collecting Data - Get the Permission First: Marketers collect data to target their market more effectively every day (they also sell the collected data to third parties). It has become a security issue because too many agencies’ have suffered from data breaches. So these days, most consumers expect to be informed before any piece of information gets tracked. All you need to do is set up a pop-up window with the data policies notification on your website.   But let’s be honest, sometimes the pop-up windows that ask for various permissions can be quite annoying to the user. So they shouldn’t appear every time someone visits your website. Instead, they can pop up only after a user starts inserting data that is collected.   Producing Expert Content: Why is it so important to keep the quality of your content as high as possible? Firstly, when people get real value from your posts, they are more likely to share them with friends and family. So they become advocates for the brand you’re building. But creating valuable content that establishes you as an authority in your field also helps with transparency. It shows your readers that you care about their time and are genuinely interested in improving their lives. Connecting with customers on such a personal level creates trust and life-long bonds.   Another thing to point out about expert content is that you need to post it often. Once a month is not good enough. One of the biggest branding mistakes for new companies is that they lack consistency. If a customer  becomes your fan, they expect great reading from you at least once a week.     Conclusion: What is brand transparency in the modern world? It’s all about making your business more truthful and open to customers. The portraits of brands are very diverse, and each company approaches trust building a little differently. But the tips from this article should help you create a more transparent business that draws people in and gains their loyalty. You’ll meet their expectations and establish relationships that last for years. And guess what? Authentic connections make people buy from you.

    "body": "2021/06/12 -  I don’t know who needs to hear this, but. . You have the right to change your mind. Okay, it was me. I needed to hear this. But just for funsies, repeat after me: “I have the right to change my mind. ” You are not obligated to keep doing things that aren’t working for you in order to impress, inspire or get the approval of anyone else. You have ONE little lifetime in your current human suit, so you might as well do more of what you love! Letting go of something that isn’t working for you is a win, not a failure. This is what I’ve been telling myself for the last few week as I contemplated dropping a big bomb on my clients, my audience, my friends… See, every once in a while I like to burn things to the ground so I can rise like a Phoenix from the ashes. Now is one of those times, so here goes: I’ve decided to exit the coaching business. **GASP** Hold-up don’t leave yet! I’m not shuttering completely, just hear me out. First, the why. Long story short… 2020 hit me like a metric ton of bricks. I’m not gonna go into details, but it was a FANTASTIC opportunity to:  Practice letting go of things I can’t control Deal with childhood trauma &amp; self-defeating BS Evaluate my prioritiesI was starting to feel more excited and clear about my life &amp; business than I ever had before and started making HUGE plans. Then, I got the covid. I’ve had symptoms for over 7 months now, and while I’m much better today, I completely lost momentum in my business. Turns out if you don’t market yourself or can’t take on clients, a coaching practice is a bitch to keep running. More importantly, I realized I’m no longer interested in doing what I was doing before I got sick. [bctt tweet=”I got into business to help people, but somewhere along the way I became a marketer. ” username=”kbagoy”] I got into business to help people, but somewhere along the way I became a marketer. I became obsessed with growth hacking and funnel design and traffic generation and capturing keywords. While I’m pretty good at it, and it’s an important part of growing a business, it’s not how I want to live on a daily basis. Sure, I could hire a team, but as an introvert, I don’t want to build or run a big company… nor do I want to be on video calls 10-20 hours per week. I want more time to rest &amp; create in quiet. So, I’m going back to product design &amp; pivoting my brand. I still want to help people, particularly people starting businesses, but not as a full-time coach. For now, I’m focused on finding a freelance or contract role, but I’m even open to FT for the 1st time in years. Having some killer healthcare coverage doesn’t sound like a bad thing after the last 6-months! Plus, after 5-years of self-employment, I honestly miss having a team to work with! I miss working on projects that have a deadline and taking a week off where I don’t think about work. I miss collaborating with other designers &amp; product people, and celebrating launches over tacos. But I felt some shame around sharing this with you. I mean, my entire brand is based around thriving financially and how to “design a life &amp; business you love. ” Now I’m telling ya I’m not so much loving my biz, nor thriving financially. 🤣🤣🤣 But… I guess, in a weird way, this is my way of talking the talk and walking the walk. I’ve gotten clarity around what I want, and I’m taking action. It’s scary. It’s uncertain. But I know it’s the right thing for me. I have the right to change my mind. Here’s what you can expect over the next few months: 1. Six Figure Freelancers will be relaunching later this year as 6FF Pro, and that will be where most of my energy will be focused. I’ll be leading group coaching calls each month, adding more trainings, and bringing in experts for skills training. I’m behind due to my energy issues, but if you want to be part of our first group you can join the waitlist here. 2. Once the launch is done, my part-time hobby will be creating passive income streams - and more content for you! In fact, I’ve just completed the design on a planner for entrepreneurs that combines techniques from my morning routine, favorite productivity techniques and a bunch of woo-woo stuff I’ve gotten into the last few years, like Law of Attraction. It’ll be up on Amazon soon so stay tuned! 3. As I figure my ish out, I’m offering instant booking sessions on SuperPeer and for a limited time I’ve added donation-based coaching. My scheduled will change as I take on design work, so go ahead and fill my calendar up while you can, I dare ya! 4. I want to bring in experts to teach skills to the 6FF Pro community on a monthly or quarterly basis. Stuff like generating passive income, growth hacking, copywriting, design… anything helpful to a micro-business owner. If that’s you, get in touch and let me know what you’d want to teach on for an hour - you’ll get a little bit of cash, some street cred, an invite to become an affiliate partner and a lot of love from me. 5. We’ll be updating katebagoy. com to reflect our new focus, but we’re dedicated to adding more content and resources for you. If you have a requested topic you’d like me to cover, reach out. And please be patient -  I apologize in advance if I break something and you get a pesky 404 error Finally, if you’re still reading… thank you! I imagine you’ve probably been following me (&amp; all my mis-adventure) for awhile if you’ve made it this far. I don’t know exactly how this pivot is gonna play out, but but I hope you stick around to watch the story unfold. XOXO, Kate "

    "title": "Things Every Entrepreneur Needs to Know About Their Taxes",
    "body": "2021/06/08 - As an entrepreneur, your success depends on the smooth run of your business. Taxes, unfortunately, can be a huge wrench in the system, suddenly forcing fees and time, and energy. And what’s worse, they are unavoidable! They come around every year (and sometimes more often) and each time they can be a pain to sort out. However, there are things you can do and precautions you can take that will make doing your taxes less stressful, less threatening, and less of an impediment to your business plans. They Can Be More Complicated: Taxes as an entrepreneur tend to be more complicated than when you’re a traditional employee. Employee forms are relatively straightforward and have not changed significantly in the past decade. Business owners, however, are constantly experiencing the frequent changes of tax reforms, new laws, new rules on deductions, etc. Entrepreneurs should be aware of any and all new updates to their tax requirements. In addition, you can expect your taxes to change if your business goes through serious growth. This means you need to keep your accounting services professional informed so you’ll be appropriately prepared. Stay aware of expectations so you won’t be blindsided or penalized for any ignorance! You’re Responsible for Everything: It’s important to know what you are expected to pay taxes on! You’ll need to account for every aspect of a business that requires financial interaction. The most obvious of these will be income taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, employment taxes, and excise taxes. Entrepreneurs are also responsible, though, for paying other taxes like social security, Medicare, and unemployment taxes. Be extremely thorough as you go through each building block of your company and determine what needs to be paid, where. If you do forget, you can be fined for not completing your dues. You Get Taxed for Being Self-Employed: You even get taxed for just being an entrepreneur! As a sole proprietor, you qualify for the self-employment tax and the personal income tax. When you are an employee, your employer (usually) takes out the employment tax automatically, as you do for your employees. There is no automatic tax take-out when you are the boss of your own paychecks. With each pay period, track how much you will owe in self-employment taxes. Even better, simply set aside a regular chunk of your payment with each period, so that you are prepared for your tax responsibilities when they come around. April 15th Isn’t the Only Tax Day: Unfortunately, filing taxes may not be a once-per-year activity. Tax returns are required only once per year, but other taxes may be required to be filed depending on profit achievements or corporation deadlines. You also may be responsible for quarterly estimated federal tax payments. Consult an experienced business person within your field to verify that you are aware and prepared for each of these tax dates, and incorporate them into your business plan timeline. Take Advantage of Deductions: Thankfully, there are a number of things that, as a business owner, you are entitled to claim as a deduction. If you work from home, deduct your home office as a housing cost. Plus, any utilities used in order to run your business, like electricity or heating and cooling systems, can be deducted in part as a required expense for your business function. Even the supplies that you use to conduct business—any technology, paper, ink, and other odds and ends, are deductible. Look also at any expenses accumulated from transportation in the name of your business. Flights and commuting to network, hold meetings with businesses that will help you develop your own, and customers, are all considered necessary and therefore deductible. If you choose to upgrade your “business” setting in any way, this too can be partially deductible, but only if the upgrades are deemed appropriate and necessary. Finally, basic rights like retirement and health insurance are always important to account for in your tax deductible. Just Ask for Help: Use the wisdom of professionals. You have enough on your plate without worrying about this constant cycle of taxes and filing, especially when you are responsible for so many various financial elements. Hiring a certified public accountant (CPA) can give you the confidence that nothing is being overlooked and everything will be done correctly. In addition, experienced accountants will know of any helpful loopholes or things to take advantage of in order to pay the lowest amount of taxes possible and get the highest tax return that you can manage. It is worth the investment to have something keeping consistent track of your financial expenditure and advising you on the long-term effects that those investments will have, especially during tax season! Keep Your Information Organized: If you don’t want to use a certified accountant (or even if you do), make sure you have a solid and effective system of organization for all of your information. Save your receipts, document, and record every purchase, categorize your information by the branch of business. Include a file of every bank statement, credit card statement, and investment. It may be helpful to make sure that everything is stored both electronically and in paper form, but only if you use the proper security measures to do so. Make it a habit to store this information! You will thank yourself when each tax due date rolls around and everything is filed neatly and orderly in one place, and you are confident nothing has been missed. Prioritize Your Payroll: The payroll is a regular turnover of your profits into the pockets of your deserving employees. This is a lot of information to keep track of though, and those employees rely on this aspect of their jobs to be done efficiently for their own income needs and for their eventual tax needs as well. The IRS takes paydays very seriously, so don’t let this fall into the cracks or you may find yourself in serious legal trouble. Stay on top of this essential aspect of business development and civil duty. You will be grateful that you have taken these precautions and prepared yourself well when you find that taxes are simply another thing to check off your list, and not a looming frustration to stress over.

    "title": "Business Expenses That You Can Write Off",
    "body": "2021/06/03 - Are you a small business owner or entrepreneur? Maybe you’re stuck in a corporate job, wondering if you’ll ever be able to afford to start up the business that you’ve been dreaming about. Well, no matter where you are along the process of starting a business, you need to know about one of the best tricks for business financing: business expense write-offs. There are lots of different business expenses that you can write off in your taxes to make your business venture a lot more affordable. Home Office Space: In 2020 and 2021, many small businesses have started creating at-home workspaces where business owners can work remotely. Especially as a business owner working out of your home office space, it is important to keep track of your spending that goes into your home office. There are a few rules that determine how many deductions your home workspace will qualify for. One easy calculation for the deduction that you earn by working on your own property and using your own space is performed as follows: Multiply $5 with the square footage of your home office. (up to 300 sq. ft. ) However, the area being calculated must qualify as your work area that is regularly and exclusively used. It can’t encompass different areas of your house. Office Supplies: One thing that many business owners forget is that a lot of your business office supplies can also qualify as write-offs. Your business equipment like desks, chairs, computers, printers, organizing cabinets, etc. could even qualify as a tax deduction. You can even deduct postage and shipping supplies. The only requirement for each of these deductions is that you use those office supplies that you’ve deducted during the indicated tax year. Travel: If your job requires you to travel often, you could qualify for certain travel write-offs in regard to your travels. You would be able to deduct and write off parking fees, business calls, baggage shipping, lodging, meals, dry cleaning, transportation by taxi, car, bus, train, or plane, and other expenses. To qualify for a tax deduction for your business travels, these have to be regular demands that take you away from your tax home, which is the area where you usually work. Transportation: In addition to traveling in general, you will want to think about the transportation that you use while traveling, as you may qualify for additional write-offs. If you are traveling often from workplace to workplace, you might be able to deduct oil and gas costs. However, you won’t be able to deduct maintenance or repairs on your business cars, so you’ll want to make sure that you take special care of your business vehicles. For example, using ceramic coating prevents scratches and other damage to your vehicle. This can help lower your transportation expenses while allowing you to qualify for write-offs. Business Meals: In most situations, you should be able to write off about half of your business food costs, given that they meet the deductible requirements. The rules of food deductions require that your meal expenses must be a normal, routine part of your business environment and schedule. In addition, a business employee or owner has to attend the meal for it to qualify. Meal deductions also require that the meals and beverages be regular food at a reasonable price. Extravagant parties or lavish food spreads do not qualify as being deductible. As far as meals that are for employees only, 50% of the total cost can be deducted. If the meal is for an office event, 100% of the costs will be deductible. Education: If your business requires you or your employees to be constantly gaining and improving new skills, you may want to look into the possible write-offs for business education. There are lots of different educational opportunities that could qualify as deductibles. Seminars, classes on specific skill sets, educational books, and specialized workshops all qualify as education write-offs. You might even be able to get your transportation costs deducted, which is a huge plus if you’re looking to travel to a different state or country for a conference or seminar. Location Expenses: There are a few different circumstances having to do with the location of your business that could qualify you for a business deductible. For example, if you rent a space for your business, you can write off your rent payments as a business expense deductible. That being said, the same rule does not apply if you are renting a home where you work. If your work requires you to move to another location, you can qualify for a deduction of your moving expenses including equipment, labor, and supplies. Phone Expenses: If you’re working at home and have one landline, you wouldn’t be able to use it as a write-off, since you will also use it for personal use. Only your second landline would qualify as a deductible. As far as cell phones go, you will be able to deduct a portion of your cell phone bill as a business write-off, but only the portion that qualifies for use specific to your business or job. For example, if you use your phone or internet connection about 50% of the time, then that should be the percentage allocable for a business tax deduction. There are so many different elements of running a business that can be expensive. Often, your bills or taxes may seem a lot larger than the profit that you make. This is why so many dreamers have ideas that never get made into businesses. However, now you know that there are many different kinds of business expenses that qualify as business write-offs, which could save you quite a bit of money. You won’t have to give up your business dream for fear of financial failure.   Take the time to go back through each of these deductibles and determine how your personal business could qualify for them. Make sure that you’re educated about the different deductibles that your business qualifies for, and you’ll be on the quick road to financial success.

    "body": "2021/06/01 - As a business owner or freelancer, you are also unknowingly becoming a salesperson. The salesperson client relationship is always tricky. How do you know what your future and current clients need? Here’s a secret; your clients care less about the product and more about the relationship they have with you. That is what keeps them coming back. Be honest, have confidence, and listen to your clients to build a lasting relationship. Honesty: The most important trait for any relationship is honesty—both with yourself and with others. According to InvoiceBerry, it’s especially important to be honest with your clients. Don’t be afraid to tell them the drawbacks and the advantages of your product when asked. Putting all your cards on the table will give your clients confidence and trust in you. Knowing about the weaknesses helps a client purchase with open eyes and preparedness. These kinds of purchases lead to future purchases as opposed to feeling betrayed and never coming back. Confidence: To be a good salesperson, you must be confident in the product you are selling. You must know every detail available with the product to answer any questions that come up. Uncertainty puts doubt in the minds of your clients and will drive them away. You are a part of the product. You must be confident in yourself too. According to Podium, if you want clients to have confidence in you and what you’re selling, you must also be confident in yourself and your products. Believe in your mission and why you do what you do. Stand tall and smile; it will help you go further than you might think. Ability to Listen: Your clients want to establish a relationship with you while purchasing your product. They want to feel like you are friends, and you are doing a service for them. The only way you can become friends is if you listen to them and make them feel like their voice is heard. People love to talk; they love to talk about themselves even more. According to Fonolo, when you listen to your client, you give them validation and support. You also allow yourself to listen to and meet your client’s needs. Doing this will establish a strong relationship and loyalty between you and your clients. Not everyone that walks in your doors will connect with you. If you are honest about your products, confident in what you sell, and listen to their needs you will find your dream clients—clients who keep coming back. For more great tips, check out my e-book! "

    "body": "2021/05/25 - Running a business is a lot of work, and sometimes adding a blog might feel like extra work on top. While writing a blog does certainly take work, it can help you to improve your business and bring in new customers in an organic way. Writing a blog can help your home-based business to improve in a variety of ways. Attracting Potential Customers: The first thing your blog will do for you is to help you bring in potential customers. For this to be effective your blog must be at least a little bit relevant to your business so that potential customers who enjoy your blog will be naturally drawn to your home business. Your blog can be a place where you cultivate relationships with your customers and help them to feel welcome in your space.

Building Your Authority: Your blog can also help you to establish credibility with your customer base and show the breadth of your knowledge. Having relevant, authoritative content is an essential content marketing element since it can increase both the time people spend on your website and your search engine ranking. By using your blog as a place where you provide relevant and useful information to your readers, you can establish yourself as an authority in your field and show them how they can apply the knowledge you provide. Generate Additional Income: As your blog gains popularity and a regular readership, you can also use it to generate passive income. Including ads and monetizing your blog can be a way to improve your home business by simply bringing in extra money. If you have products you are passionate about by other small businesses, creating partnerships on your blog can allow you to add value for your customers and readers while also making a little extra money.   Whether you have blogged before or are just starting in the world of blogging, it can make a big difference for your business.

Not only do you have to train yourself in branding and goal setting, but you must work at mastering new skills as the industry progresses. The marketing world has shifted quite a bit and will continue to change. Making yourself as adaptable as possible will improve your status in the field. Learn Everything You Can: It is wise to learn as much as you can about the different facets of marketing. While there are some great traditional marketing strategies that still work and will never change, some elements have shifted to the digital sphere. Embracing these adjustments will help you apply your skills to all sorts of situations. Take online courses about the different tools you can use. Social media is a great resource to start from. After that, you can expand to other pieces of software that make marketing a bit easier. Be willing to go to marketing conferences to learn about the latest tools in the industry. More knowledge can never hurt. Get Certified in Your Field: Once you have taken several courses or gone to school for marketing, you should get certified as a real marketer. Getting certified means following higher ethical standards that can result in problems if you violate them. But being certified also means that customers will be more likely to trust you and take you seriously as a business venture. Certification may take a while to obtain, but it proves that you care about your craft. If you honor the certification, it can be incredibly rewarding in the long term. Focus Your Efforts: After you have been certified and learned all that you can to help you in your career, it is time to home on one specific kind of business. While it is perfectly acceptable to vary your target businesses, you can gain a lot more experience and status by choosing one or two kinds of businesses to focus on. Narrowing the types of businesses can make your work a higher quality. While it may be tempting to pursue every single business under the sun, it may make your work feel rushed and unrelated—confusing both your firm and your clients. Unifying your team under one target audience makes things simpler. With these things in mind, you should be able to feel completely confident in your marketing experience. You have learned all that you can, you have been certified, and you have chosen a specific audience for your company. Now you just have to reel in the customers.

    "title": "Why You Don’t Need to Move to a Major City to Be Successful",
    "body": "2021/05/18 - When people imagine growing up and beginning their adult life, they always imagine a  move to a  major city. While large cities have many opportunities to offer, they are not the only road to success. Suburban areas and small towns are becoming homes for small businesses and freelance workers. There’s Promise in Smaller Cities: Every large city was once small. More sky risers filled with more people does not mean that the major city is better. According to SpareFoot, if you move to a small city, there is more job security because you have less competition, and they will often appreciate your work more. In a way, smaller cities are similar to being a part of a start-up business because you will have the opportunity to be part of something bigger than yourself and watch it grow. You can also use the closer-knit atmosphere to your advantage if you start a small business and build connections with those around you. Physical Location is Less Important: As companies move online and technology becomes more readily available, it is also becoming much easier to work or go to school remotely. As an employee, you can work thousands of miles away from your physical office and communicate online-there’s less need to move to a major city these days.   According to DaVinci, as the employer, you can secure a virtual office with an address in any major city you want. Your permanent address does not dictate where you need to work.   People can be connected through the internet and still be productive. In many cases, workers find that they are more productive when they work remotely. Save Your Money: Living in a large city comes with a price, quite literally. Major cities tend to have a large cost of living, meaning that although you might get paid more, you are keeping less of your income because you are trying to finance yourself. According to Business Insider, in a small town or city, food, gas, and housing are often more cost-effective. If you are working remotely, you can use that same income you would have in the city to fund a much nicer home where you plan to move. You can also save money on gas because everything is closer together and your car will have lower mileage than if you lived in a city. Successful living is no longer confined to the big cities. You can live a full life with a good income anywhere you want, from small towns to state capitols or while traveling. Dreaming big does not mean you have to live big. You can build a successful business from anywhere in the world. To learn my best secrets for success, check out my book! "

    "body": "2021/05/13 - Being an entrepreneur is hard work, especially when you’re first getting started and struggling with productivity. There’s a lot of work to do, and at least initially the vast majority of it has to be done by you. Because of that, you need to be able to manage your time and stay productive. Fortunately, there are some strategies you can use to boost your productivity. The Pomodoro Method: It may sound counterintuitive, but taking regular breaks can help you be more productive. That’s the idea that the Pomodoro method is based on. To use the Pomodoro method, set a timer for a predetermined amount of time during which you will work, typically 25 minutes. When the timer goes off, you take a short break, after which you go to work for another 25 minutes. The idea is that when you take regular breaks, you give yourself a chance to relax and refresh yourself mentally, which will help you focus better and make better use of your time while you’re working. 5S: For the most part, people tend to be more productive when they’re operating in an organized environment. The five steps in the 5S strategy can be especially helpful for organizing your space. They help you identify areas where you can do better, figure out how to do better, create standard operating procedures for doing better, and maintain your state of doing better. In short, it’s a tool that you can use to have a place for everything and make sure that everything is in its place. That way you’ll have a place to work where you know where everything is so you don’t have to waste time trying to find things. Self Care: Arguably one of the most important strategies you can use to boost your productivity is self-care, specifically in terms of making sure that your basic needs for maintaining your health are met. That means making sure you’re getting enough sleep, exercising, and eating a balanced diet. It’s a lot easier to do good work and stay focused and productive when you feel healthy, alert, and energized. If you find yourself lacking the energy to maintain your productivity, take a look at how you’re taking care of yourself and see if there’s an area that could stand to be improved. Having strategies you can use to boost your productivity can be especially helpful as an entrepreneur. Making use of the Pomodoro method and 5S, as well as taking care of yourself can be very useful tools if you use them right. It may take some trial and error, but work to find the tools that work best for you so you can maintain an optimal level of productivity. Ready to become a successful entrepreneur?

    "title": "Office Expenses That Can Qualify for a Tax Deduction",
    "body": "2021/05/11 - Running a business is a lot of work, but it can also get extremely expensive. That’s why being aware of the tax deductions you have at your disposal can help you to make your business more sustainable. Many of the everyday (and less frequent) office expenses of running a business can be deducted, which can make your life a little easier while you are running your business. Rent or Mortgage: One of the biggest expenses you will incur as a business owner is the rent or mortgage you pay for your office space. This is true even if you run your business from home. Luckily, the rent and mortgage that you pay for your business space can be deducted from your taxes to help make running your business a bit more manageable. There are rules and guidelines that specifically outline what parts of mortgage and rent can be deducted, so it is important to do some research or hire a tax professional to figure out the logistics. The more you know about deducting those expenses, the easier it will be. Energy Bills: Energy bills are always expensive, but when you are running a business, they can go up even further. Your energy use tends to go way up when you are working to keep your business going, so deducting your energy bills can help to keep you afloat. The government knows that it takes a lot of energy to keep your business going, so they offer tax deductions to offset some of the energy costs involved in running your business. Keep track of your energy expenses each year so you can take advantage of those deductions and avoid paying more taxes than you should. Heating and Cooling: In addition to your energy bills, the systems that help you provide that energy can also be deducted in some cases. Having an updated HVAC system can help you to improve the efficiency of your office and keep things running smoothly. Sometimes you simply need to tune up your current system while in other cases you may need to have the whole thing replaced. HVAC systems can get expensive, especially for an office. Make sure to take advantage of the available deductions so that you can decrease your expenses for taking care of such an important project. Office Supplies: Office supplies may seem like pretty small expenses, but they add up over time so it is worth using the deduction. Office supplies can be deducted fully because generally a workplace simply buys what they need for the year. Other things like toner have to be deducted a little differently, but they still qualify for a deduction. It is a good practice to talk through your office supplies deductions with a professional so that you know you are making each deduction appropriately. Having a record of your purchases can make the process easier on you and will give you something to look back on when making your deductions. Office Furniture: You may not need to replace office furniture too often, but when you do, you’ll notice that it can get pretty pricey. The office furniture tax deduction comes in handy when you are buying or replacing office furniture. You can deduct your entire office furniture purchase resulting in a certain percentage back depending on your tax bracket. This can have a huge impact on your overall expenditures and help you to manage your finances a little more easily. There are also bonus depreciation options depending on your overall spending that you should look into. Your Tech Purchases: A lot of business money goes into buying the technology that will allow your business to function. When you add up all your tech purchases from computers to software and even accessories, it can add up to a pretty big expense. Luckily, there are deductions available to help offset those essential costs. You can either deduct your computer in full upfront or use depreciation to spread the deduction over time. It is estimated by the IRS that a computer will be good for 5 years, so you can purchase a new computer and deduct it on that schedule if you continue to use computers for your work. Certain Education Expenses: Another great deduction is education expenses. You can’t deduct just any educational expense, but if it allows you to maintain or increase your business-related skills and abilities, you can deduct it. This makes growing your skill base and continuing to hone your expertise much more manageable from a financial standpoint. Improving your education and skills is an important part of running a business, so you may as well take advantage of these deductions so you can become even better at your job and earn more profits in the future. Your Business Insurance: Every business needs insurance to protect itself in a variety of ways. Deductions for business-related insurance can help you to decrease your costs while still getting the protection you need. From insurance on your office space to liability insurance, you must protect yourself and your business in case anything happens. Hopefully, your insurance will simply be a precaution, but, likely, you will need to claim from time to time. In addition to deducting insurance costs, it is also a good idea to shop around and bundle your policies so you can get the best possible deal while insuring your company. Dealing with the expenses of a company can be a demanding job, but with the help of deductions, it can be a little bit easier. Make sure to thoroughly track all of your purchases so you can make filing your taxes a little bit less complicated. As a business owner, you have a lot on your plate, so it is in your best interest to take advantage of any deductions or benefits you have available to you throughout the process.

    "body": "2021/04/27 - Building your creativity can improve your life in a variety of ways, especially if you’re in a creative job field. However, if you are busy running a business and taking care of your responsibilities, it can be hard to make time to attend a class specifically to improve your creativity. It’s lucky, then, that there are many ways to increase your creativity and hone your skills without taking a class. Practice Every Day: No skill can be improved without regular practice, and honing your creative craft is no different. It can be difficult to develop a habit, especially one like improving your creativity each day. It might help to set a timer for yourself and practice your creativity at the same time each day. Bringing your creative outlet with you to appointments and other events where you may need to wait around for a while is another great way to help get your practice in and make sure that you are always improving. Join the Online Design Community: Finding a creative community always helps to develop your creativity and get you on the right track towards becoming more creative yourself. Joining a creative community has never been easier since there are so many different options online to help you build your creativity and get to know other creatives in your community and around the world. There are many designer blogs that are very helpful for aspiring designers. Staying on top of the information you have available online can help you to learn about new creative trends and find places to hone and use your creativity. Get Feedback on Your Creative Work: Showing people the creative projects you have put together can be intimidating, but it can help you to get even better. While feedback from people you love can be affirming, it is sometimes difficult to believe them when they like your work. Finding other people working on the same kinds of creative works as you to give mutual feedback can be an easy way to get feedback that is constructive and helpful. Since you are already involved in an online design community (if you followed the previous tip), that can be a great way to get feedback. If you are interested in increasing your creativity, there are lots of easy ways to do it. There are so many options besides classes to help you develop the skills you need. If you’re struggling to find time to take a class, one of these options may just be the right one for you. Are you ready to start your 6-figure business and help it thrive?

    "title": "Guest Post: The Quickest Ways for Small Businesses to Turn a Cold Lead Into a New Client",
    "body": "2021/04/22 - It takes time for any person to turn into a potential customer for your business.   Even if your target has seen your marketing campaigns and heard of your brand in the past, they probably won’t be ready to buy straight away.   That’s why organizations and businesses invest so much time and effort into finding ways to transform cold leads into potential clients.   The term “cold lead” refers to someone who isn’t yet interested in purchasing your product or service. Sometimes, they haven’t even heard of your business before.   Getting to the conversion point with these individuals means getting to know their interests, providing them with valuable information, and gradually nudging them towards the sale.   Here are some of the quickest ways to turn those cold leads into clients.   Know How to Find the Right Leads: You’ll have a much easier time converting your cold leads into clients if you start targeting the right potential customers from day one.   This means providing all members on your sales team with information about your target customer.   Developing a strong set of user personas that your team can use to identify the correct leads will ensure they’re spending their valuable time on the people most likely to convert.   There are even tools out there that can help you to collect information about your user—and access it as a way of “qualifying” each lead with a potential value score.   Once you know what an ideal client might look like for your business, you’ll even be able to create entire best-practice playbooks for your sales team members to follow.   Your sales team should be able to rely on comprehensive best-practice guidelines and support that make targeting leads easy.   Use Lead Magnets: Lead magnets are the tools that help you attract potential customers to your business without as much effort from your sales team.   You can regard them as a form of inbound marketing assets, intended to convince your customers to reach out to you, and provide their information, so you can convert them into a paying client in the future.   A lead magnet sits on a landing page or a squeeze page in your website. It provides customers with something they find valuable in exchange for their contact information.   For instance, you can offer a free eBook download to customers who might be interested in joining your community.   Once they give you their email to receive the eBook, you can create an email marketing campaign designed to nurture that lead into a paying customer.   If possible, A/B test your lead magnet options to see which offers are more likely to convince your customers to sign up for your newsletter.   You can also A/B test copy and other factors.   Know Your Differentiators: It is important to understand your customers when you’re trying to turn cold leads into sales, but it’s also crucial to know your brand and how it compares to the competition.   That’s where user personas come into play. You should have a decent insight into the pain points and issues that your customers frequently face, thanks to your user personas.   Using that information, ask yourself what you can offer that your competitors can’t.   You may need to conduct some competitor analysis at this point.   This will help you notice if there are any valuable extras that you can provide to your customers that your competition has missed.   You may even discover extra customer groups that you can target, ones that have previously under-served by existing brands.   Once you know your differentiators, create a document that can go alongside your brand guidelines.   This information will give your sales reps insights into what they should be focusing on in each pitch.   Some businesses even create playbooks and scripts to help their teams.   Don’t Forget Cold Calling: Cold calling might be one of the older strategies available to connect your brand with customers today, but it remains valuable when you’re trying to collect leads.   Cold calling means finding potential lists of would-be customers and reaching out to them with messages that you’ve tailor-made to address their needs and pain points.   However, you have to go about it the right way. The important thing to remember when you’re getting started with cold calling is that this kind of outbound marketing can be irritating if you don’t know how to do it correctly.   You need to ensure that you’re targeting the customers who are most interested in your offer.   You’ll also need to work hard on crafting a sales pitch that immediately appeals to your audience.   Through an effective cold-calling strategy, you can begin building a relationship with your customer that can evolve through further conversations, demos, and even online meetings.   Train Your Team: Your ability to successfully convert cold leads into interested customers depends heavily on the experience that your team members can offer.   Today’s clients are becoming increasingly demanding when it comes to the kind of support and service they expect.   With that in mind, be ready to train your team members as regularly as possible.   As you collect information from customer conversations in your CRM system, use the data you gather to update your training strategies. Your goal should be to give your team members extra guidance. Help them out with difficult conversations by giving them potential scripts to follow or assigning mentors that can step in when a call gets out of hand.   The more confident your team members are in their abilities, and the more information they have to guide them through the sales process, the less likely they’ll be to make dangerous mistakes.   Remember to take advantage of technology to collect valuable insights from your sales reps, so you can add them to your training strategies later.   Start Converting Those Leads: Every customer starts as a cold lead—even your most dedicated clients.   Being able to strengthen your brand image and attract more sales means knowing how to make the most of your cold lead conversion strategies.   With the tips above, you should have everything you need to begin pushing conversations with would-be clients in the right direction.     [author] [author_image timthumb=’on’]https://katebagoy. com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jasmine_W. . jpeg[/author_image] [author_info]Jasmine Williams covers the good and the bad of today’s business and marketing.

    "title": "How to Stay Sane While Working From Home",
    "body": "2021/04/20 - When it comes to working from home, you may have been doing it for a while and may still feel incredibly sick of it. But even though it’s been a while since COVID first affected everybody’s work experience, you may still feel the need to reevaluate your process of working from home. Think about these ideas to get off to a great start. Organize Your Space: One of the first things you can do to make sure that you stay sane in the process of working from home is setting up a clean and organized space. When you like the layout of your desk space and know where everything goes, you’ll feel happier to work there. Adding a plant and lighting will make your space homier and brighter. Create Boundaries: When you’re figuring out how to work from home, think about the boundaries that you need to set up. You’ll want to set boundaries with your family members as well as with your coworkers to make sure that you aren’t pulled thin in the process of navigating working from home. Make sure your family knows when you will be unavailable—try to set the same expectation that they would have had when you were going to the office. It’s as if you aren’t home. Then, make sure your coworkers understand when you are unavailable so that you don’t end up having to have meetings at really uncomfortable hours. Take Breaks: When you’re working at home, there are fewer outside motivators to help you divide up your time. When you’re working from home, it can be easy to let work bleed into other things—you may want to just finish a project and end up taking an hour and a half longer than you would have normally. Though you may be tempted to think that working hard and pushing through is a good thing, you may end up getting burned out more quickly. Take time to take breaks and make sure that you don’t let your work take over your life. Go Outside: When you’re cooped up inside all day without in-person interaction with coworkers, being inside can get to you. When you’re working at home, you have a little more flexibility when it comes to what your work environment looks like. Getting outside can have a lot of positive benefits and it can be as simple as planning to spend some time in your backyard or planning to go to a park to do some of your work. Decks have many benefits and are great spaces to work in a relaxing environment. If you already have a deck, take advantage of it. Set up comfortable outdoor furniture and add an umbrella if you need shade. Set Clear Goals: One way to ensure that you can be productive and get your work done more efficiently when working from home is by setting clear goals. Because it is often easier to get distracted or feel less motivated when you aren’t at the office, setting goals for yourself and for your time will help you get the things you need to get done quicker. If you need to, you can even set simple goals like “answer my emails” in the next 25 minutes or “call Amy” at 3:15. Setting little goals like these and then accomplishing them helps build your motivation and your focus. Manage Your Time: When you’re working at home, you have more flexibility; but with more flexibility, it also becomes easier to not distinguish between your personal and work time. When you begin each day, make a clear plan for the day. When you do this type of planning, you may end up allocating work time differently than you might have when working at an office 9–5 pm. But this way, you can allow yourself to do the other errands you need to do for yourself and also make sure that you accomplish the work that needs to get done that day. Create a Separate Workspace: In addition to setting a clear plan for your time each day, having a separate space set apart specifically for your work can also help you be more productive. When you work on your bed or at the kitchen table, it can be hard to be as productive as you normally are. For one, working on your bed means that you don’t have the same physical support as you would have sitting at a desk. Second, doing your work at a place that tends to be in a common area of the house like in your kitchen means that you are likely to be interrupted frequently. Try and find even a corner in a room in your house where you can work and won’t be disturbed. Having this separate space will also allow you to separate your personal and work life more. Emphasize Communication with Coworkers: Of all the things that you can do to make your work life smoother as you work from home, making sure you have solid communication with your coworkers is one of the most important. Good communication is always beneficial in the workplace, but when you’re working at home and have fewer opportunities to discuss your different projects, the time you do have in meetings with your fellow team members is even more critical. Make sure that you focus on setting a clear agenda before each meeting so that you use the time productively. And then make sure that you end each meeting by clarifying each person’s responsibilities. When everyone has the chance to go around and state the different tasks they have been assigned, you’ll be able to ensure that there is no confusion about who is doing what and that everyone comfortably understands their role. Working from home can be incredibly challenging. And it can feel hard to stay sane at some times. Thinking about some of these ideas can help you take steps toward achieving a healthy balance as you work from home. Need help marketing your business? Get a step-by-step guide here. "

    "title": "Aspects of Your Business That Can Benefit From Stronger Cybersecurity",
    "body": "2021/04/06 - Strong cybersecurity is vital to running a successful business. From competitors to disgruntled consumers, businesses face a lot of things that could easily be labeled as threats. Marketing and customer service are the most common tools businesses have at their disposal to deal with those, but what about the ones you can’t see? Hackers and viruses can take advantage of vulnerabilities in a variety of aspects of businesses. You’ll need proactive cybersecurity if you’re to protect your business. Customer Data: When customers interact with your business, they often end up sharing a fair amount of data with you. They do so because they trust you to protect it. According to Data Privacy Manager, failing to protect customer data has a myriad of unpleasant results, not the least of which is how it harms your reputation as a business. Having strong cybersecurity protecting customer data suggests that you value your customers enough to have their interests in mind as well as your own. Don’t store data unless it’s necessary, and make sure what you do store is encrypted to help keep it protected. Accounting: Your customers aren’t the only ones you need to protect. You need to protect your business accounts too. You can have the best customer data protection in the world, but if you don’t do the same for your accounting and financial accounts, you could be dangerously vulnerable. The good news is that you don’t necessarily have to come up with your security all by yourself. According to Quarium, third-party Quickbooks hosting can lead to better security. Outsourcing your cybersecurity to people who are experts in the field can give you a leg up when it comes to protecting your business. Online Payment Processing: Some of the most sensitive customer data you end up with is data you collect during payment processing.

    "title": "What Review Sites Should You Pay the Most Attention To",
    "body": "2021/03/30 - With the advent of the internet, many places have opened up for people to leave reviews of the businesses they frequent. With all these review sites available, it is important to understand which are most important and will have the biggest impact on your business overall. Here are a few of the review sites that you should keep in mind when you are looking into your client reviews. Google Reviews: For many consumers, your Google reviews will be one of the first things they will learn about your company. Managing your Google reviews, then, is incredibly important to your reputation as a brand and your ability to gain new customers. Having a high number of positive Google reviews can improve the number of clicks you get through to your website, which has a positive impact on your sales. Make sure to ask for reviews from your customers so that you can have a large number of positive reviews on your Google reviews. You know you have customers who love what you are doing, so you may as well get their input on your Google reviews. Facebook Reviews: Facebook reviews are also important. For a large demographic, Facebook is where they get their company and product information. These reviews will also impact how your business shows up on search engines because Google takes Facebook reviews into account in their rankings. This is important because most people don’t look very far down the list when they search for a business. The higher your business appears on searches the more likely people are to click on your website and shop for your products and services. Yelp Reviews: Yelp is a really popular site for reviews, and it is important to keep track of any reviews you may have on their platform. When bad reviews come through, it can be tempting to ignore them or respond angrily, but you and your business should respond positively and try to resolve the issue. Sometimes you can turn a bad review into a good one by talking to the reviewer and working to fix the problem. Updating your page on Yelp can also help your SEO and help you to move up on searches and improve your reputation online. Managing reviews online can help you to keep your reputation sparkling and to resolve issues with frustrated customers or clients. That way, it is a win for everyone.

    "title": "Why a Thoughtful SEO Strategy is a Must for Your Online Business",
    "body": "2021/03/24 - Your business’s SEO plan is about more than just rising in the ranks on Google. A carefully implemented and thoughtful SEO strategy can help your business shine in multiple areas. Because of the time-consuming load that is required by SEO, many businesses try to rush through the various tasks involved. It’s important that you take the time to do it right. However, if you take your time, you’ll find that many of these tasks involve vital improvements to your business’s appearance, efficiency, and brand. They are things you need to do anyways, and it’s better if you get it done right the first time. Build Credibility: Credibility is everything in the business world. If consumers or other businesses don’t believe that you have expertise or ethics, your business is going to struggle obtaining and maintaining client relationships. Most people will only trust the first few results on a search engine. If they don’t find their answer, they’ll try a different search. That means if you don’t rank high on the results, you’ll never be seen. This is because you aren’t viewed as credible by the searcher. A solid SEO strategy will focus on a modern website design, efficient organization, and valuable content. These items will appeal to search engine algorithms and increase your ranking, they will also appeal to those that visit your website. A sleek design and informative content will help visitors see that you are a business that cares about its reputation. Generate Your Own Leads: Without customers, your business is just a drain for money. Getting customers can be difficult and costly. While you can pay people to bring you leads, it’s better if you can find those leads on your own. For example, you can pay a search engine to rank you on the first page. While you will get noticed, your website is going to be flagged with an Ad symbol. You’ll have to pay each time someone clicks on your ad. Buying leads can be costly over the long-term for your business. If you focus on boosting your SEO, you’ll rank high without having to pay for it or having that Ad symbol attached to your result. Increased Engagement and Traffic: If you are a small business, it’s highly unlikely that your SEO can compete with the big players in your industry at a national or world scale. However, you don’t need to. A thoughtful SEO strategy is going to focus on reaching individuals searching within the area that you serve. By focusing your efforts in this manner, you won’t be wasting money on rising in the rankings for people outside your service area. Instead, you’ll be rising in the rankings of people that you can actually convert to clients. Not only is this more efficient in terms of client conversion, but is also easier. There will be less competition for rankings at the local search level. To promote engagement on the local level, you should start off by optimizing your social media and your Google My Business accounts. These are easy steps to take that don’t require a lot of expertise. When it comes to your SEO, it’s your goal—and responsibility—to ensure that you can do what’s necessary to keep things running smoothly. Carefully making a plan and staying up-to-date with your website’s content will help your online business presence to succeed. Need help marketing your business? Get my step-by-step guide today! "

    "title": "Guest Post: The Dos and Don'ts of Building Backlinks to Your Business Blog",
    "body": "2021/03/16 - Succeeding in the digital world means learning how to rank high on the search engines for your chosen industry and location.   The easier it is for customers to find you when they’re active on Google, the more likely it is that you’ll end up with valuable leads and conversions. As most business owners already know, SEO can be a complicated process for beginners, with many ever-changing rules to be aware of.   Google’s frequently updating algorithms also often make it difficult to keep track of which strategies really work today.   One factor that has remained consistently important to better rankings for quite some time, however, is link building. Generating valuable backlinks from authoritative, reliable, and highly ranked websites instantly gives your own online presence a boost in credibility.   So, how do you successfully generate the best backlinks for your blog? Here are some dos and don’ts to guide you.   Do Produce High-Quality Content: Quality content is one of the most powerful tools a business can have. It’s a great way to market yourself by showcasing your thought leadership and expertise.   At the same time, the content you produce on your business blog could answer valuable questions that your customers have about your products or services.   Producing relevant, high-quality content keeps customers coming back to your website.   This, in turn, improves your standing with the search engines.   However, the same content will also help you earn backlinks from other companies that want to reference your insights, statistics, and other information. To boost your chances of earning links, focus on producing linkable assets that generate attention from other quality sites.   These assets might include white papers with exclusive information, checklists, infographics, and case studies. Ask yourself what you would want to link out to from your website.   Do Offer Genuine Value to Target Sites: Your blog content should always offer value to both your customers and the people you want to link to it.   However, you might need to offer some additional value to other website owners if you’re hoping for a place on their blog.   Remember that some of the market-leading companies on the web today receive hundreds of requests for backlinks on almost a constant basis.   Rather than focusing on what you want from that company with your pitch, describe what you can give them in return.   Is there any exclusive information that you can share as part of a guest post that would be extremely helpful to their target audience?  Also, will you be able to offer the backlinking business a spot on your site with a guest post so they can reach more customers? Ask yourself what’s going to appeal to the company that you’re reaching out to right now.   Maybe you could even create an infographic for them to use, so they have some new valuable information to share in a more consumable format? Do Research Every Site You Reach Out To: Many business owners make the mistake of putting quantity above quality when searching for backlinking opportunities.   They reach out to huge numbers of companies at once, using the same copy-pasted pitch every time.   However, failing to make a genuine connection with the webmasters whose help you want could mean missing out on a great opportunity. Whenever you consider reaching out to a site for a backlinking opportunity, take your time to research that company.   Find out what kind of content they produce and make a genuine suggestion about something you can offer that might be valuable to their customers.   Offer suggestions on how your content could build on a blog or article they already have.   Researching each target website also means that you can ensure any company you reach out to is properly aligned with your brand image in terms of values, mission, and customer base.   This will help to stop you from linking your business to any company that could pull your reputation in the wrong direction.   Don’t Pay for Links on Low-Quality Sites: Building a successful backlink strategy takes a lot of time and commitment. For businesses keen to get new leads as quickly as possible, it’s difficult to be patient.   You might even find yourself looking into link buying opportunities to speed things along.   Unfortunately, buying links is almost never a good idea.   Often, you end up with spammy references to your business placed on low-quality websites.   Additionally, since the Penguin update, the more Google notices spammy links pointing to your site, the more likely it is that your search ranking will end up getting penalized.   Avoid paying for links on any website if you can, but if you do pay for a boost, make sure that you only do so when you know you’re working with a highly reputable brand and website.   Don’t Use Black-Hat Tactics: In the SEO world, black-hat tactics refer to the underhanded methods some impatient website owners use to build their ranking online.   There are various forms of black-hat strategies that are common in the backlinking world, including paying people to place links to your website in the comments of blogs belonging to other sites or adding “hidden text links” to pages.   [caption id=”attachment_40257” align=”aligncenter” width=”512”] source: unsplash. com[/caption] Some black hat tactics seem worse than others, like injecting links, which involves hacking into another companies’ website to place a link to your site there against the webmaster’s will.   However, even something simple, like swapping links regularly between two domains, can appear as a red flag to the Google SEO algorithm.   Anything that may come across as an attempt to manipulate the Google search algorithms or increase your ranking without the appropriate work could be dangerous for your site.   Don’t Ask Just Anyone for Backlinks: Not all backlinks are created equal.   Having hundreds of links to your website from websites that aren’t remotely related to your business won’t increase your rankings.   If anything, links from irrelevant and low-quality websites are more likely to lead to penalties from Google.   The only way to discover the true benefits of a good backlinking portfolio is to make sure you reach out to the most relevant and valuable sites, who already have credibility in your industry.   This also means looking up some background information. Take your time to research blogs and websites with a connection to your niche and learn about domain authority before you make a connection.   Proper link prospecting, where you examine the relevance of a site, and the value a backlink from that environment can offer, will save you a lot of headache with SEO penalization and missing ROI.   Don’t rush into backlinking and end up damaging your company’s reputation in the process.   Get the Best Backlinks for Your Business: Backlinks are valuable assets for a business hoping to strengthen brand awareness and improve credibility online.   Collecting backlinks from relevant, high-authority companies is an excellent way to access more leads and even improve your search engine ranking.   However, it’s vital to approach your link strategy carefully.   Don’t race into getting links from just any website. Take your time to do the appropriate research, and approach valuable websites with the right pitch.   Easing into this process will save you a lot of effort in the long run and potentially even help you avoid any mishaps with Google’s algorithms.   [author] [author_image timthumb=’on’]https://pbs. twimg. com/profile_images/690119805312077824/gtqI0TG3_400x400. png[/author_image] [author_info]Lisa Michaels is a freelance writer, editor, and a thriving content marketing consultant from Portland.

    "title": "The Devil is in the Details: Tips for Putting Your Best Foot Forward in Your Business Photo",
    "body": "2021/03/10 - As a business owner, you are expected to present a certain image to the rest of the world, at least when it comes to presenting yourself as a business owner. Because of this, the way you look in professional photos matters and can significantly impact both the impression you make as an owner and the impression your business makes. So what should you be doing to make sure you put your best foot forward when it comes time to take your professional business photo? Choosing Your Background: One of the first details you’ll need to make decisions about is your background. Your background should make sense for both the industry you work in and your business specifically. Often indoor settings provide a more traditionally professional image, but you can opt for an outdoor photoshoot. Think about the image you want to portray. The background you choose sets the tone for the business photo. The owner of a fitness gym will likely have a different background preference than a freelance writer. If you opt for an indoor setting, take care to make sure that the area you’re having your photo taken in is properly clean. You should be using high-resolution images, which can make it easier to notice dirty surfaces. Make sure to properly dust any wood furniture or other surfaces that could collect dust. Have any windows in the background thoroughly cleaned. Organize the room so everything is neat, orderly, and free of clutter. Dress the Part: Once you’ve planned your background, it’s time to get yourself put together. You should be dressing the part of a business owner for the business you operate. Like the background, what is most appropriate will depend on the specific business and industry you’re in and the tone and image you want to present. How you dress will say a lot about you to your clients, so choose your clothes wisely. Understanding different levels of dress code can help guide you in your choices. Personal Grooming: Proper personal grooming can add a finished look to your appearance that can boost your level of professionalism in your business photo. If you intend to get your hair cut, plan to have that done two to four weeks before your photo shoot. That gives you time to get used to your new haircut, for it to grow a little so it looks more natural, and for you to get anything fixed if you need to. A manicure can be a good way for both men and women to make sure their nails are well kept and neatly trimmed. Carefully consider wearing makeup too. This isn’t the best time to be trying a whole new makeup look. Ideally, it should be something you’re confident in doing and can do very well.   Men, don’t think this doesn’t apply to you. Make sure any facial hair is well-groomed and under control. At a bare minimum, you should apply a clear lip balm and be using moisturizer to make sure your face doesn’t look dry and chapped. If you’re missing hair on the top of your head, opt for powder makeup to keep the light from reflecting off your head. A simple concealer and foundation can help even out your skin and hide blemishes. Be sure to practice beforehand unless you choose to opt to use a makeup professional. Choose Your Position: Once you have yourself put together, you’ll need to plan how you want to position yourself. How you choose to position yourself can impact the way you come across in the photo. As a business owner and professional, it’s a good idea to carry yourself with confidence to portray that in your photo. Think about the angle of your body, your head, how you’ll hold your arms, whether you’ll be sitting or standing, even whether or not you want to look at the camera or go for a more candid shot. All of these things will affect the image of yourself that comes through in the photo. Facial Expression: Do you want to come across as a more casual, lighthearted professional? Or do you want to portray a more down-to-earth, all-about-business persona? The facial expression you choose gives your photo character. Will you be smiling or serious? Take some time to practice a few different expressions in the mirror before making your decision. Once you’ve made your choice, practice it until you’re satisfied that you can do it without looking. This is just one of the ways you can improve your smile so you feel confident in it if you choose to go that route. If you have a hard time choosing just one, pick two or three that you can use during your photo shoot and have the photographer take pictures of all of them. Trying a variety of facial expressions, poses, and angles gives you a chance to capture a variety of images so you can choose the one that best suits the image you want to portray. Choosing Your Headshot: Your business photo will likely end up being a type of headshot. It’s important to recognize that there are different kinds of headshots since that will impact the final image. Choose the type of headshot that best conveys the image you want to put out. How much personality do you want to portray? Do you prefer to be strictly professional? Knowing what you want your photo to communicate will help you make the best choice. Remember to practice your posing for headshots just as much as you would for full-body photos. Doing so can help you make your position look natural and attractive, even slimming if that’s something desirable for you. Having your photo taken professionally as a business owner is a big deal. There’s a reason why people say a picture is worth a thousand words. Your business photo will have a real impact on how you and your business are perceived by others. Make sure you pay careful attention to every detail before, during, and after the process. Pick the photo that best represents everything you stand for and everything you want your business to represent.

    "title": "Guest Post: Interactive Content Types That Will Delight Your Small Business Customers",
    "body": "2021/03/02 - Content marketing is undoubtedly critical for the success of your small business. Interactive content encourages your users to actively engage with your content instead of passively consuming it.   This gives your small business an amazing opportunity to achieve a deeper relationship with your customers, understand them better and quantify your leads. If you put interactive content at the center of your content marketing strategy, you’re bound to achieve great results.   Since implementing any novelty can seem hard, we’ve made a list of interactive content types that you should try to excite and delight your customers.   Quizzes: Quizzes are great multimedia tools that can greatly benefit your content strategy.   Their main advantage is that, unlike images, texts, or videos, quizzes are interactive.   This makes them valuable content marketing assets.   When you use quizzes to interact with your audience, you have the opportunity to collect data from quiz-takers on their customer wants, likes and dislikes, and use the insights you’ve gathered to create new content that will cater to those needs.   The best example of using quizzes to deliver a powerful marketing strategy is BuzzFeed. The website has had a top 40 Alexa ranking in the USA and remains extremely successful at reaching new audiences.   Thanks to user-centered quizzes like “Which town should you live in?”, BuzzFeed has managed to reach dozens of millions of users. Like any great content, quizzes are also extremely shareable.   When paired with a well-thought-out lead generation strategy, they have the potential to reach new audiences. This makes them valuable content marketing assets.   Interactive Calculators : Calculators are a fantastic way to demonstrate the value of your business to your audience and generate leads as a result.   When you use calculators to compute an answer relevant to solving your audience’s problem, you showcase the practical value of your solution. This puts you in the right position to convert even casual visitors to your website into clients.   With calculators, you also collect data that the users are entering and use it to understand your audience better. For example, imagine having a free custom app that helps users by calculating how much money they could save by using your product. On the one hand, the user immediately begins to connect the solution you offer with their pain point and perceive how they could benefit from implementing it. On the other, and perhaps more importantly, thanks to those calculator results, in addition to demonstrating how your service could help them, you will have gained input data from the user and created a viable lead to convert.   In short, you benefit the client and the sales team with this simple element. If you want your content strategy to succeed, adding interactive calculators to your content toolbox is a great way to find out more about your audience, showcase value, and capture leads.   Polls and Surveys : A poll is a gateway for meaningful interaction between your business and your audience. Everyone likes to feel like their opinions are heard and it’s even better when you can use those insights to the benefit of your company and the service it provides. Polls and surveys are quick and interactive elements which can help you get single-question answers from your audience and add value to your business.   If they’re well written, they’re going to spark interesting interactions with users and provide valuable insights on particular topics from your industry.   A great poll or survey experience will grab the participant’s attention, make them pause and think for a moment, and interact.   To make the interaction feel natural, it is also a good idea to follow up with the lead after they have interacted with you. For example, influencers regularly use Instagram polls to enhance their marketing strategy.   Influencers and Instagram experts utilize sticker polls to organically reach enormous audiences, increase engagement and collect user feedback for market research.   The data they get also includes the total number of views and votes, which helps them get an overview of their reach. You should view polls and surveys as powerful tools for your brand’s marketing and lead generation and use them alongside your social media strategy.   Panoramic and 3D videos : Panoramic and 3D videos offer an immersive experience that sparks customer interaction better than regular videos.   Since videos are some of the most important ways to promote your brand, you should take them to the next level by making them as interactive as possible to create a unique and impactful user experience.   Increased conversion rates will be the result.   Such videos excel at capturing the users’ attention in a short amount of time and leave them with a more long-lasting impression.   Unlike traditional video ads, 3D videos offer a sense of size, orientation, and distance that make your product seem more tangible.   This makes such videos the perfect interactive tool for presenting your product to your audience.   For example, Hong Kong Airlines released a 360-degree video for marketing purposes, and it was 35 times more effective than the same ad in a traditional 2D format.   If you want to supercharge your content marketing strategy and provide your audience with shareable, interactive content, panoramic and 3D videos are a must-have in your content toolkit.   Interactive Educational Content : Educational eBooks, webinars, and similar content keep your audience engaged for hours, provide value and generate opportunities for leads.   They are highly interactive and, if used properly, a valuable asset for your business.   Similar to a sales pitch, interactive educational content reveals problems and provides solutions, and as such, it is an ideal tool for successful soft sales.   Even if you don’t close the sale, the seminar will still leave you with volumes of useful data that is sure to help your marketing team.   A report by DemandGen, available for download here, has found that uses are most willing to register and share information about themselves in exchange for webinars (51%), survey reports (50%), and white papers (40%). Therefore, knowing how to host a seminar is critical for creating an amazing learning experience that generates leads and provides the kind of value that helps you nurture relationships with the participants.   When it comes to engaging with your audience, interactive educational content is the crown jewel of your content marketing strategy.   Conclusion: When you create content that sparkes engagement and shows value, users will want to do business with you. In this post, we’ve talked about the potential of interactive content for your business.   These include:  quizzes interactive calculators engaging polls and surveys  panoramic and 3D videos interactive educational contentThis doesn’t mean traditional forms of content, like blogs, videos, or images, are no longer relevant, but rather that you can always push for ways to enrich your content marketing toolkit. Encouraging more interaction with your audiences is a great way to do it.   If you want to supercharge your content marketing strategy, start thinking about what kind of interactive content will be the most effective for your small business.     [author] [author_image timthumb=’on’]https://katebagoy. com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/michelle_headshot. png[/author_image] [author_info]Michelle Laurey is a telecommuting wordsmith who especially likes writing on a cloudy day.

    "body": "2021/02/23 - In this world of endless information, there are no limits in ad marketing and advertising. All you have to do is to choose the right platform, but it can be difficult to know which platform to use. You should start by using Instagram, Facebook, and Google ads. Each of these platforms will help you to reach your audience and boost your company. Instagram: Instagram is a great option for advertisers since it’s a mobile-first platform created with the mobile audience in mind.

Paid advertising on Instagram can be an effective way for your business to connect with your potential customers and achieve objectives.

Google Ads: With Google ads, ads can show on both desktop and mobile devices. When using display ads, you can use device targeting to target only smartphone and/or tablet users. On this platform, you can publish ads within apps, browsers, and Google search results. The key differentiator for Google Ads is its access to the most popular search engine, which allows advertisers to put their ads in front of the largest audience on the planet. Placing ads can be tricky, but if you know which platforms to place them on, it can be easy. You should start with Instagram, Facebook, and Google Ads.

    "body": "2021/02/09 - Starting your own business can be an exciting adventure. Success brings financial security, stability, and an opportunity to build wealth that most 9-5 jobs don’t allow you to achieve. Of course, the road to success is paved with obstacles and initial challenges that you’ll have to overcome before you see the fruits of your labors. Long Hours: Starting your own business isn’t a get rich quick scheme. It requires a lot of work and a lot of patience to confront the initial challenges. You’ll likely need to invest a lot of hours in the beginning. This may go on for months or even years. According to MYVA360, it typically takes around three years to establish your business, and that most tend to see success somewhere around the 7–10 year mark. If you want your business to succeed, you need to be willing to put the work into it to make it succeed. Finding Funds: While there are always exceptions, starting up your own business tends to cost a great deal of money. Especially considering the year we’ve just come from, that’s something that is in short supply for many. This can make funding a new business venture tricky. Some options include business loans, crowdfunding, or tapping into personal savings. According to Franchise Gator, you can tap into retirement funds through a Rollover for Business Startups (ROBS) to finance your business. Be careful before you decide to tap into retirement funds though. Depending on your situation and how much financing you need, that may or may not be your best option. Making Decisions: There are a lot of different decisions business owners have to make. In fact, according to Productive Club, making decisions is a never-ending responsibility that can lead to developing decision fatigue. You’ll be making decisions constantly, from big ones that impact the future of the company to lesser ones that may only impact a single employee. No decision regarding your business will only impact yourself. To make the right decisions, you’ll have to weigh the impact they’ll have on your customers, your employees, and your business as a whole. If you aren’t mentally prepared, that can become a pretty impactful stressor. There are some significant initial challenges you’ll face when you start up your own business. Most new businesses will require you to put in long hours, find funding, and make virtually all of the decisions yourself. If you navigate these and other obstacles successfully, however, you can watch as your business prospers to the point where you can step back and enjoy your success.

    "body": "2021/02/02 - While it can be hard to follow every single rule your business should follow, it is essential to your business’s survival. Before they open up shop, business owners should know what legal requirements they need to follow. As you grow and expand there are important things not to miss. Get out your pen and reading glasses, because there are a lot of documents to receive and sign. Proper Registration: A business must have the proper registration to be considered legal in your area. This helps the government monitor the taxes your business owns. If you skip registration, you can be taken down by the IRS and be barraged by fines. You should figure out how to get the proper permits immediately. Thankfully, this isn’t the most difficult thing to figure out. As LegalZoom points out, Each state and city has its own requirements. Look on the official government website for your area to see what permits you need for your company. Fill out the paperwork, pay the fee, and you should be good to go. Insurance: You should also make sure your business has the proper insurance for your company and for your employees, should you decide to bring others on. On a national level, full-time employees are required to have some sort of health insurance. According to Barnes Disability Advocates, states set the requirements, so you need to check that you are complying. Insurance will not only keep you out of legal battles with the government, but it will also mitigate legal battles between you and your part-time employees. Insurance is obviously essential. Safety Protocol: You should also make sure your business is keeping with safety codes. Safety can refer to several different things. COVID-19 has forced the government to include social distancing and mask-wearing requirements for local businesses. Although many of us will be working from home or online, should you decide to collaborate in local coffee shops and coworking spaces these are things to keep in mind. Should you decide to set up a brick and mortar space, your business should also meet fire and building codes. Without this, your whole workforce could be in danger if a natural disaster were to strike while they were on the job. You should take every caution to ensure those working with you will be safe. These are only a few of the legal requirements you should meet to open your business. Without them, your company could put others at risk or get taken down by one legitimate lawsuit. Safety codes and legal requirements don’t just keep others safe, but they keep your livelihood secure. Need some extra help getting off the ground? Grab my step-by-step guide here. "

    "body": "2021/01/26 - Learning to market effectively and efficiently is an important part of succeeding as a small business owner. Whatever your marketing budget may be, learning to use it well will help you to reach a wider audience and bring in new customers so that you can experience a high return on your marketing investment. Professional Design: If you aren’t a designer yourself, it is probably worthwhile to hire a professional designer to take care of your design needs. Well-designed ads and content will bring in your audience and increase your success. With the help of a professional designer, you can brand your company in a way that is cohesive and compelling and will encourage others to use your products and services. Many potential customers will judge companies immediately based on their designs, so when you know your materials have been designed well, you know you’ll make a good impression. Paid Social Media Ads: Social media ads can be a great way to reach a broad but targeted audience without having to put in too much effort or money. Millions of people are on social media sites which make them ideal places to market products and services. With social media advertisements, you can seek out particular demographics and find customers that you may miss through your other marketing ventures. Build a Money-Making Website: Your company’s website is an important tool to build your business, bring in new customers, and initiate sales. A website that is failing to convert new customers is a waste of your marketing budget. Make your website easy to use and understand to help your customers be able to make purchases easily and quickly. Include links, reviews and banner ads as well to make your products readily available and help your website make you more money and make the most of your marketing budget. Strengthen SEO: Even if you have the best website and content in the world, your website won’t be able to do well if no one ever sees it. Having solid SEO will help you to ensure that your website is easy to find and appears near or at the top of search results. Most people will only look at the first few links after searching, so getting your company closer to the top will ensure that it is seen by more eyes and has a better chance of getting someone’s attention. Improving SEO is all about creating content consistently that is relevant to your business and website. By regularly updating that content, you can help your site to stay at the top of search results. Be smart about your use of meta data and links to continue strengthening the SEO on your site. Work on Calls to Action: Effective marketing depends on strong calls to action that encourage customers to take the next step and purchase products. IF you currently have marketing copy that is failing to meet your needs, work on testing out new calls to action to improve those materials and increase conversion. Investing some of your budget into creating high quality calls to action will help your business to be more successful and make your marketing more effective. Effective marketing gets customers to do something, whether it is buying a product or clicking a link. A call to action is the tool you have available to help encourage that action. Landing pages in particular are a great place to engage your audience. By optimizing your calls to action, you can help customers to make the next move and really invest their time and money into your products and your company. Analyze Your Engagement: It is difficult to improve your marketing processes if you don’t know what is working and what is not. By taking time and part of your budget to get a strong analysis of your current marketing methods, you can see where you need to put more time and money and what things simply aren’t working. The more you know about your current marketing and its effectiveness, the better you can make your marketing processes for the future. By investing time and energy into performing an analysis, you can set your business up for future success and a continually improving process. Optimize Old Posts: If you’ve written blog posts in the past that were great but aren’t getting the conversion you want to see, that can be a great opportunity to update. Spend time and your marketing budget going through old posts and materials to see how you can change and update them to increase engagement and get more out of them. This can be a great method to improve your conversion because it is often easier than writing entirely new material but can produce similar results. Work on making every piece of writing on your website and blog strong and clear so it helps customers make purchases and increases the success of your company. Localize Your Website: If you are looking into growing your company and reaching an international audience, it may be time to work on localizing your website. Most large businesses have different versions of their website for different countries, and by doing that as well, you can reach a much wider audience by targeting your demographic around the world. This is a step that really requires an investment of time and money but can pay off in a big way with increased business and awareness. Making sure that all localizations are professionally done and that translations are accurate and make sense will help your site to do better abroad. Using your marketing budget effectively will help your business be more successful and bring you customers who are excited about your product. When you know your audience and are able to reach them effectively with your marketing materials, you are sure to make a good impression and keep them coming back. No matter what business you are in, having a good marketing strategy can be the thing that brings you even more success and makes your business known across the country and the world.

    "title": "How to Reach More Potential Clients For Your Business",
    "body": "2021/01/11 - Marketing requires time and/or money. For these precious resources to be spent effectively, you need to make sure that your marketing materials are being put in front of individuals that are in your target market and potential clients. It isn’t super useful to spend time and money on an advertisement for senior medication and then run the ad on a children’s channel. While this is a pretty obvious example, other mistakes may not be so obvious. You can avoid many of the pitfalls and reach your target market by employing the following tips. Understand Your Target Demographics: According to Woblogger, you should start your advertising endeavors by determining who your target market is. Be specific. For example, if you have a sci-fi action figure, don’t just say kids. A more specific target audience would be kids that enjoy watching the sci-fi show that the action figure comes from. Once you understand who belongs in your target audience, you need to understand more about their habits. In the previous example, you could reasonably deduce that fans of the show will regularly watch certain channels. You can also make guesses as to other media outlets that they will commonly use. The more that you can learn about your potential client’s habits, likes, and dislikes, the better you will be able to reach out to them and effectively market your products. Expand Your Advertising Strategies: Another way to reach more of your potential clients is to change up the way that you try to contact them. Some of the more conventional methods are TV advertisements, email blasts, website banner ads, social media ads, and text messages. However, you can also use flyers, catalogs, billboards, brand merchandise, car-wraps and audio. Audio ads are growing in popularity due to popular music streaming services and radios. According to Audiohook, digital audio advertising spending was projected to reach over $3 billion in 2020. Post Regularly: Several small interactions with your potential clients are often more effective than one large interaction. According to Volusion, that is why it is so important for you to be posting regularly on your business blog and on your social media accounts. This can take a fair amount of effort. You can make things easier if you plan out a month’s schedule for posts. This will help you to have a cohesive message and have engaging content without running out of ideas. Avoid the temptation to always post about ads. This can be annoying to your following. As you work on your advertising, have a little patience. It takes time to grow a loyal customer base for your business. Keep working at it and you’ll start to see results. Don’t be afraid to change up your strategy if you discover that it isn’t working out as planned. Above all, make sure that you stay connected with your potential clients’ needs.

And this was my story not so long ago. Soon after accepting a “dream job” with a Silicon Valley startup I realized that it was more of a nightmare. I wasn’t doing the work I love - design. Instead, all my time was spent in meetings. And then there was the office politics. Tiptoeing around the boss’ favorites. The ass-kissing. The stolen ideas where I got zero credit. Even worse? My office was a trailer sandwiched in between other trailers. Looking out the window was like looking out into a corporate armageddon. No wonder that my drive, my spirit, and my ambition withered away a little more every day. The money? It was good - very good. But it just wasn’t enough on its own. So I quit my job without a real plan - and grabbed whatever low-paying gig I could. It didn’t take long to start falling behind financially. Even worse… I become just another commodity, up for grabs by the highest bidder. Which was ridiculous with my skill set! I mean I had that skills to land a six-figure job at a Silicon Valley startup, so why wasn’t I thriving on my own? Actually, there was a massive reason why.

Back: This is exactly what held me back. And I’ll bet that it’s what’s holding you back too. I had the mindset of an employee. Not a business owner. And if you have that mindset when you start your freelance business… You’re almost doomed to fail. You’ll feel like an impostor who doesn’t measure up, despite your amazing skills. It makes you hesitate to go after your dream clients… Because in the back of your mind, there’s that nagging voice, “What if I fail?” What hangs over you is the awful realization if this doesn’t work, you’ll have to find another soul-crushing, mind-numbing J-O-B.

This time, the job was more aligned with my values, and I actually enjoyed it. But after about 18 months, the familiar burnout and fatigue set back in. I needed a break. So I packed my bags for a vacation to Bali and Cambodia, desperately hoping I’d get my mojo back. Although there were many things about my job that I loved, in my heart I knew this wasn’t what I was meant to do with my life. So I started to think about going on my own again. But I knew I had to approach things a lot differently. My choice of reading material for that trip was the catalyst I needed to figure out what I wanted and needed to do with my life. And that was “The Four-Hour Workweek” by Tim Ferris. As I read the book, it dawned on me that my freelance goals were wishy-washy. Sure I wanted my own business and to make good money. But don’t all freelancers want that, too? Something just clicked as I read that book.

I didn’t really know WHY I wanted my own business…or WHAT I wanted it to look like…or WHO I wanted to serve. And until I got clear on those things, no amount of conventional wisdom on how to start a business was going to help. That’s why I hadn’t succeeded before.

The right choices matter. And nearly everything in life is a choice. So often, I talk to people who claim to want to start a freelance business but fail repeatedly. It’s not because they don’t want it. It’s not because they can’t do it. Now, I’ve built a business where I get to work with my type of people: entrepreneurial, creative, and non-traditional. I’ve found my tribe, one where “that’s just how it’s always been done” is never the answer.

After helping out tons of other people to build six-figure freelancing, coaching, and consulting businesses, I’ve realized one thing. A traditional step-by-step business plan isn’t what you need to succeed. Making the mindset shift you need to succeed as a business owner is probably the hardest thing you’ll face in building your six-figure freelancing, coaching, or consulting business. And it’s not your fault. Most of us are taught growing up that we should get a good education, then look for a job that comes with a decent paycheck. Entrepreneurship is rarely taught in school, so we have employee mindsets… That’s why so many of us feel out of our league when we step out on our own. So it’s no wonder that so many of us struggle to build businesses! And it’s not because there is a lack of info out there on the nuts and bolts of creating and executing a business plan. There is tons of free information out there on the internet and YouTube. Business is a mindset game, and many people new to freelancing or coaching (especially women) don’t get that at first. I didn’t either. But once I figured out the rules (with the help of an MBA) then I became unstoppable. And I can help you make the mindset shift you need to thrive as a freelancer, coach, or consultant too.

    "body": "2020/12/15 - When you are creating a business plan it can be difficult to decide what to put in and what you don’t need to think about yet. There are so many unexpected scenarios that could happen to your business. It can be hard to know what is necessary to make sure you’re prepared. The following tips can help keep your business on the right track. Intended Business Structure: One of the most important things you can do for your business plan is to write out a comprehensive description of your business structure. Having a clear understanding of this structure will help you be more successful in the long run. The business structure you choose can affect your liability and your tax needs in the future. It is essential to choose the right structure for your business and to lay it out in your business plan. By incorporating your business, you gain a level of protection and separate from your business as it becomes its own entity. Research various business structures carefully so you can choose the best option for your business. Dissolution Procedures: It may seem counterintuitive to start a business with its potential end in mind but having a clear plan in writing can save you trouble in the long run. It’s helpful to clearly outline dissolution procedures from the start. This will prove helpful in the event that following such procedures becomes necessary. Regardless of how well you thought your business might do in the beginning, sometimes things go awry. In some cases, dissolution is the best option. You and your business partner might have different ideas in mind or want to try something new. The more prepared you are, and the clearer your business plan is on the dissolution process, the easier your life will be. Working with your partner to decide this in the first place can save stress, time, and money. Invest the time early so you can save yourself trouble down the road. A Mission and Vision Statement: Having a clear idea of what you are trying to do can give you direction from the beginning. When creating your business plan, your mission statement should be concise and clear and very readable. A good mission statement gives a general overview of the goals of your business but doesn’t make decisions prematurely. It should work as a tool for you to evaluate how well you are meeting your business goals. It shouldn’t create unrealistic expectations or be too close-minded about your company’s future. Leave room for growth and change in your business while still having a main goal. Your mission statement can be a great asset to help you attract support and show the values of your company. Creating a business plan is an exciting opportunity to build your future. Use these tips to make your plan as strong as possible and prepare yourself and your business for the future, whatever it may bring. Need help starting your consulting business?

    "title": "3 Myths About Starting a Business that You Shouldn't Buy Into",
    "body": "2020/12/08 - Entrepreneurship is a fascinating field. One of the most intriguing aspects of starting a business is that it is not well understood, even by those that are good at it. Many successful entrepreneurs have struggled to understand their own success. Some have even misattributed their success to aspects that aren’t that helpful. In some cases, this has generated myths about entrepreneurial success. Here are a few of those. You Need to Have Experience: One way to be successful in entrepreneurship is to have a lot of business experience and connections. However, that is not the only way. Experience is not a requirement. In fact, experience can get in the way. When we are overly exposed to something, we fail to see it for what it truly is. Think about when you first start a job. You might notice a lot of things that are inefficient. However, over time you justify these things to yourself and you lose sight of how things could improve. Experienced individuals often struggle to see the possibilities that an inexperienced person can see. The ability to see possibilities is a key skill for anyone starting a business. You Need to Have Lots of Money: There are some out there that bemoan the fact that they lack the funding to pursue their ideas when starting a business. Sadly, it isn’t money that is their issue. It’s their perspective. You don’t need lots of money to start a business, and you don’t need venture funding. In fact, too much money at the wrong time can kill your business. Many of the most successful companies have been bootstrapped by founders with little financial backing. You don’t even need a lot of money to advertise. There are marketing methods that don’t cost a fortune that you can use to market your business. This may mean that you have to do the work yourself, but that’s better than handing over equity to someone in exchange for some cash. You Need to Be First: There are many people out there that get excited because they just had a new idea. They start researching the idea only to be disappointed that someone has already beat them to the prize. They then quit without ever really starting. This is a horrible mistake. If another business is already running on your idea, that means it works! We live in a large world, with large markets. Being the second, third, or even tenth to the market isn’t always a bad thing. You can avoid the pitfalls of your predecessors and enjoy the benefits of a market that is new enough to be growing, but old enough that people aren’t wary of the product. Entrepreneurship is a road full of failures and setbacks. That much is unavoidable. However, you shouldn’t give up because of the obstacles. You should embrace them and learn from them. Just think, if Thomas Edison had given up after his first few tries, he never would have figured out the light bulb. Who knows? You could come up with the next greatest business. Ready to start your own business but not sure where to start? Get started here! "

    "title": "How to Tell If Your Marketing Strategy Is Working",
    "body": "2020/11/30 - Every business owner is curious to know whether or not their marketing strategy is actually working. Understanding why your strategy is faltering—or why it’s working—is essential to know. Here are a couple things you can do to see if your marketing strategy is actually doing its job. Compare the Actual Results to the Expected Results: At the onset of your marketing strategy, you and your team probably projected a certain amount of sales. But what is the point in setting goals if you don’t compare your projected increase to your current trends in sales. If you really want to know if your marketing strategy is working, it is time to see whether you are falling short of your initial goal. If you and your team are not meeting the mark when it comes to projected sales, there are several things you can do to get back on track. First, ensure that you are catering to the right audience. Second, make plans and goals to increase customer retention, size, and frequency. Use an Attribution Model: A decent portion of business owners aren’t sure how to measure or interpret their marketing strategy’s effectiveness. Fortunately, using attribution models can help define the efficacy of your marketing channels. In simpler terms, an attribution model helps business owners recognize what channels customers most frequently interact with before they decide to purchase an item or service. There are different attribution models you can use to figure out if your strategy is responsible for the improved performance you’re observing. One is the first-touch attribution model which measures which channels tend to first bring customers to your website. Another is the lead-conversion touch attribution which measures which channels tend to generate leads on sales. Try these to see if your marketing strategy is really working Surveys—Just Ask Your Customers: One of the cheapest and simplest ways of measuring the efficacy of your marketing strategy is through online or in-store surveys. Sometimes business owners try so hard to hypothesize what their customers are feeling—but nobody can read minds. For this reason, surveys or questionnaires can help you and your marketing team understand if your marketing strategy is actually doing its job. There is no use in spending money on a marketing initiative if it isn’t fulfilling its original or projected purpose. Take the time to meet with your marketing team to compare your actual and expected results, analyze your attribution models, and offer surveys to customers. Then make the necessary changes to reach your sales goal. To really get your business up and running be sure to grab my top secrets here! "

    "title": "How to Write a Blog Article People Will Want to Read",
    "body": "2020/11/12 - Obviously, every blog writer wants people to read their articles. Why else would they write them? But what is the secret? Honestly, there isn’t just one. There are a lot of things that go into crafting a good blog article that people will actually get all the way through without skipping parts. Come Up With a Catchy Title: Your title is your hook. If you can’t write a good title, no one is even going to click on your article. On the other hand, people have really come to hate clickbait titles, so you need to find a balance, and that isn’t easy. Brainstorming is a great way to get started. Buzzfeed writers come up with 20 headlines before picking one. When thinking of different titles, try to be specific and interesting. Consider if you would actually click on a link with the title you are writing. If the answer is no, it is likely other people won’t click on it either, so go back to the drawing board. If you are struggling, try thinking of different kinds of titles. Listicles, questions, and how tos are always going to be popular. Put Thought Into Your Intro: While it may seem obvious, you need a good introduction. That is the first thing that people read. It is the first introduction to your writing and whether or not they want to invest the time into reading more. If your introduction is off the topic of your title, it comes across as inaccurate and sends people right to the back button. If it is boring, they may not want to read. If it has mistakes, they won’t trust your writing. You don’t have to make the introduction the best piece of writing you have ever done, but you do need to make sure that it does the job of completing the hook that the title started. Appeal to Emotion: Cut and dry informative content may be useful, but if held up next to an article that provides the same information while appealing to emotion, it is going to lose out on readers every time. Engaging people’s emotions is a careful art. You need to target the right emotions for your piece. When you succeed the result is golden. When coming up with your article outline, decide what you want people to feel when they finish reading. Then, use that to shape how you convey the information. Tapping into emotions doesn’t mean they have to be super excited or angry at the end. They could feel satisfied, intrigued, or informed. It is important to know who you are talking to and how to get them to feel that way. Try writing from different and inspiring locations in order to invoke your own emotions. That will surely shine through in your writing. Using these elements to boost your writing takes practice. Like everything else with running a blog, nothing happens overnight, so don’t give up if it seems hard at first or if you don’t think it is working. Just keep trying and refining your process each time. Need help marketing your business? Get my step-by-step guide here. "

    "title": "Guest Post: Low-Cost Tactics to Quickly Get a Small Business Blog Off the Ground",
    "body": "2020/11/04 - Blogging is one of the most valuable tools in your digital arsenal. It’s a way to demonstrate your thought leadership to potential customers by sharing rich, informative content while boosting your online presence. The more blogs you create, the more content Google has to index on your site.   If you combine your blogging strategy with some SEO, a little social promotion, and a few other techniques, your business will gain more attention in no time. The biggest problem for most small business leaders is figuring out how to get their blog off the ground in the first place. How do you ensure that people want to read what you’re sharing on your website? What does it take to keep visitors coming back for more? Here are some low-cost tactics to get you started.   Write Valuable Content for All Stages of the Buyer Journey: There’s more to the average buyer journey than arriving on a blog post and immediately deciding to purchase a product. Your audience will want to learn as much as possible about your business, your product, and the benefits you can offer before handing over their cash.   To create an effective blog, you’ll need to establish a content strategy that encompasses all parts of the customer journey, from the moment when consumers first start recognizing a problem they need to solve, to conversion.   There are three stages of that journey, and your content strategy will include some of the following blogging strategies:  For Awareness, create blog posts that address some common problems your audience has. For instance, if you’re a site selling digital marketing services, you might write a blog post listing the biggest issues people have with earning attention online.  For Consideration, you’ll need to present your product as an effective solution for their problem. Case studies and interviews showcasing the results of happy customers are very useful here. So is any other content that demonstrates your unique selling points.     For the Decision stage, you’ll need to overcome any concerns your potential customers still have about buying from you. Blog posts showcasing the greatest benefits of your product or service will be useful here. It is also a good idea to create how-to articles demonstrating how easy it is to use your product. Since these stages educate your audience about a problem that your product or service solves and guide them towards a purchase, it is essential to produce suitable content for each of them. Encourage Social Sharing: Once you have plenty of valuable content to share with your audience, the next step is increasing the reach of the posts you’ve created. If you already have a social presence, sharing your blog posts on social media is an excellent idea. For instance, you can promote quotes from your blog on Instagram with eye-catching visuals. Alternatively, direct customers to your latest content on Facebook with promoted posts that include links back to your website. Remember, most social shares are more appealing when they include images, so make sure you have a featured picture on each post to grab attention.   Don’t forget to give your audience the power to share your content with their social connections too. At the bottom or side of your blog post, include sharing buttons that allow your audience to instantly share their favorite articles online. You might even add little “click to tweet” sections over some of the most quote-friendly parts of your copy.   Remember to avoid spamming your audience on social media with nothing but links to your latest content. Create a social strategy that combines blog promotion with meaningful insights, curated content from other companies, and more. Promote Your Blogs Elsewhere: Social media is a great place to show off your content – but it’s far from the only option. If you have existing customers who signed up for a membership with your website after purchasing something in the past, keep them up to date with newsletters that showcase your latest blog content.   Don’t forget to encourage new customers to sign up for the same newsletter. Having a great email list is an excellent way to nurture leads that might not be ready to convert straight away. An email list can also turn one-off clients into repeat customers.   In addition to taking advantage of email, try sharing your blog posts as answers to questions on forum-based sites like Reddit and Quora. Just ensure that you’re not spamming links to your blogs on every topic.   If you’re responding to a question on a forum, start by giving an informative answer, then offer the link to your blog post as an additional source of information.   Have a Strategy for SEO: These days, if you want to run a successful online business, you need to know the basics of SEO. One of the easiest ways to help readers find your blog, and learn about your company, is to boost your presence on search engines like Google. If your customers find your website when they’re looking for solutions to specific problems, they’re more likely to interact with you.   Creating a distinctive online presence is particularly important for startups, since they need to establish themselves as thought leaders and demonstrate their expertise to get a part of the market.   When writing your blogs, think carefully about how you can implement elements of SEO without losing your unique voice.   Your posts need to include keywords, links, and other elements to capture the Google crawling bots’ attention. This will instantly improve your chances of getting the attention of new buyers. However, don’t forget that, first and foremost, you’re writing for real human beings. Don’t let your quest to include keywords and other elements in your blogs leave them sounding spammy or inauthentic.   Collaborate with Other Content Creators: It can feel as though everyone in your industry is a competitor when you’re first trying to build a substantial presence in the digital world. However, there are some groups out there that could be valuable partners on the path to success.   When you’re just starting out, you can lean on collaborators to gain a share of their influence and boost your appearance on the web.   For instance, sending an influencer a freebie from your business and asking for a review in return is an easy way to attract new customers to your brand. The right influencer will showcase your company in a positive light and earn you traffic that you may never have found otherwise.   Also, try collaborating with other companies by guest blogging on sites that are relevant to your industry. Writing a unique article for another site gives you a chance to reach new customers. At the same time, the site that hosts your article gets access to fresh content that strengthens its position online. It’s a win-win! Get Your Blog Off the Ground: Getting a blog to the point where it can generate some serious traffic and revenue takes time. You won’t achieve success overnight. However, you also don’t have to spend a fortune reaching your goals. Try some of the low-cost strategies mentioned above, and you will get your blog off the ground in no time.

    "title": "What it Takes to Start a Consulting Business Online - Lessons Learned After 5 years of Self-Employment",
    "body": "2020/09/28 - It’s November 2017, and I’m sitting in the Milk &amp; Madu cafe in Canggu, Bali, with my housemate Alice, sweating our asses off in the tropical heat.   The fans slowly turn overhead, plates clatter, and keyboards clack as 100’s of nomads dig into their healthy breakfasts of avocado toast, gluten-free waffles, and acai bowls before starting their workday.   God, I miss the days when we could go out in public, don’t you? Anyway, Alice is an event planner based out of Dubai, but she’s taken a sabbatical because she’s burnt out.   She’s tired of working for a crazy boss, sitting in meetings, and dealing with corporate BS.   Alice thinks she wants to start a consulting business, but she’s overwhelmed AF. I’d been traveling full-time for about a year at this point and running a business for 3, so she’s quizzing me about how I find clients, how I work remotely, how I got over the horrible fear of starting my own business… And as we’re talking and I’m guiding her into a potential path forward with her own business, I realize there are many more people out there like Alice.   People out there who hate working in corporate America.   People who are tired of endless meetings and walking through miles of cubicle farms to get their coffee. People who are sick of eating lunch at their desk, feeling under-appreciated… and trapped. They want more freedom.   They might want to start a consulting business, or go freelance, or build an agency - and they have ALL the skills they need - but they’re scared shitless of giving up that paycheck and benefits. And I’m in a unique position to help - because I’ve done it. So we finish up breakfast, and we go to work - Alice on homework I give her, me on an idea that would change my whole business. I think about what I wish I’d known back when I was trapped in corporate and dying to get out.   I think about what I wish I’d known earlier on in my business journey - the strategies and little hacks that had allowed me to drastically change my life. I think about what I would do if I wanted to start a business and make money FAST because I NEEDED to quit my soul-sucking job.   I sit down and write the outline for what would later become my ebook, Secrets of a Six-Figure Freelancer. Then I write and write and write, and wrote the entire book in a day.   And then I had the idea to make it an online program.   So, within a month, I created a sales page and reached out to everyone in my network who might be interested.   Every freelancer I knew, everyone who had mentioned wanting to start a business, everyone I knew on Remote Year, everyone I was connected with on LinkedIn… I invited them to enroll, and I asked people to share.   And I somehow got 30 people to sign up!  So, in the early months of 2019, in my rented Airbnb room in the suburbs of Melbourne, Australia, I used my 4-year-old laptop to create a course that would change my life - and thousands of others.   I had no idea at the time what this would become. This little idea I’d had at a cafe in Bali has led to a totally different business model (I was coaching startup clients at the time) and took me from consultant to coach, author, course creator, and entrepreneur. That single idea - and some fast action - has led to a lot more freedom and fulfillment. Because a plan doesn’t need to be a big, complicated thing. All I knew was that I had a desire to help people skip the struggle that I experienced when I started my business; I didn’t know what that looked like or how I’d do it - I simply took the next logical step. Two years later, we’ve made some enhancements, and more than 1500 people have gone through the Six Figure Framework™. And I know we’re onto something here because I keep seeing results like these:   The program works because my clients don’t waste time chasing trends, getting overwhelmed by free advice, or focusing on the number of likes or follows they get. They get real, strategic, PROVEN, timeless business strategy from an MBA with 10 years of experience in branding, marketing, and starting businesses.  They learn to simplify, prioritize, and stop trying to do everything.  They learn to build a brand instead of hunting for gigs.   They learn to get focused on the clients they want and how they can serve them best.  They learn to be consistent in their marketing, messaging, and promotions to attract more leads.  They learn to have sales conversations without feeling like a “salesman. ” They learn to price based on value instead of time spent. And probably most importantly, they get mindset training for becoming resilient, thinking like a business owner, and shifting their beliefs around money. They create confidence, stop second-guessing themselves, and start taking action. Every. Single. Day. I’m SO proud of this program.   So, starting in 2021, I’ll be going all-in on Six Figure Freelancers &amp; exiting the one-on-one coaching business*. We’ll be pivoting to a membership model, re-doing all the videos, and adding monthly training, mastermind calls, and more. But in the meantime, if you’d like to lock in lifetime access to the current program, I’ve opened up enrollment.   You’ll get the same step-by-step strategies my private and group coaching clients have used to land $5,000 &amp; $10,000 (or even $80,000!) client contracts in their first 6-months in business. And you can get started today for just a couple hundred bucks. :) Click here to save your seat! *I’ll still be offering private sessions, but only as an upgrade to active members of Six-Figure Freelancers. If you’ve wanted to work with me in a private business coaching program, NOW is the time to apply - these programs will be discontinued to the public in 2022. Not ready for the course?

    "title": "So you Want to Start a Lifestyle Business? Dealing with that mind trash is priority #1",
    "body": "2020/09/24 - Start a Lifestyle Business, They Said, It’ll be Easy,They Said…Hey, I’m Kate Bagoy, a former corporate slave turned freedom seeker, spiritual junkie, life hacker, and travel addict. I started my coaching practice as a “lifestyle business” and I’ve built my entire brand while traveling to 25-ish countries, often working from the beach, and based solely on my Instagram feed, my life probably looks perfect. News flash: it’s not. No one has a perfect life, no matter how it looks online.  You don’t know who’s had heartbreak or pain or depression or struggle.  You don’t know who’s got 100K followers but can barely afford their rent.  You don’t know who hasn’t cleaned their house for 6 weeks because they suddenly have kids at home full-time and work full-time from their closet and side-hustle half-time and are all-kind-of-stressed out about the nightmare that is US politics right now. Remember this for ALL the friends and “influencers” you follow online… You’re seeing a highlight reel, so STOP COMPARING YOURSELF. Shaming yourself for not being perfect is a guaranteed way to stay stuck where you are. I’m 42 years old, been single for 3 years, have a negative net worth thanks to $120,000 worth of student loans and still don’t know what I want to do with my life. I’m also happier than I’ve ever been because I stopped trying to live someone else’s idea of a perfect life. Once upon a time, I worked for a Fortune 500 sportswear company, made great money, had killer benefits, a fat 401K and was living the “American dream. ” I hated my life - but I was great at pretending everything was okay, even when I was drinking myself to sleep every night. In 2008 I finally wised up and decided to stop pretending everything was okay. I quit my job without a plan and tried freelancing. I say tried, ‘cause I FAILED. I hustled 60 hours a week working with broke-ass “make the logo bigger” clients, and could barely pay my mortgage. It was so exhausting I decided to get my master’s degree just so I could live off student loans. :) That got me into startups, UX design, marketing, growth hacking - and a breakdown lead to me getting sober &amp; doing mindset work. When I decided to go freelance again in 2014, it was a different game. It turns out that freelancing, when approached as a BUSINESS (not a job hunt), can be quite lucrative and easy. But most creative people - or anyone who’s spent their career as an employee - don’t know how to business. I mean, it’s overwhelming AF, right? First, you’ve got the fear and self-doubt that shows up in the form of procrastination, imposter syndrome, paralysis by analysis, and over-complication. Then there are eleventy-million people online who will guarantee you success if you just follow their top-secret method and “HUSTLE MORE. ”  What they fail to tell you is this… Hustling on the wrong sh*t is a guaranteed way to burn yourself out and go broke. All the social posts in the world, no matter how great, will do jack shit for your business if you don’t have the right foundation. The “perfect” Facebook ad will bankrupt you if you don’t have the right funnel in place. And your self-sabotaging “I’m not good enough” mind trash will block you at every stage of your business if you don’t start to address it. This is true wether you want to start a lifestyle business or you want to open up a salon. Your mindset is the #1 factor in your success, followed closely by your ability to work on the right things at the right time. : That’s why I started Six Figure Freelancers. I wanted to give slightly-crazy, freedom-seeking, over-achievers like you a shortcut to a thriving business. If you’re not already an accelerator member, join now. You’ll learn how to get rid of the mind trash that’s keeping you stuck, and get good old-fashioned, time-tested, proven business strategy.

    "title": "Guest Post: 7 Tips for Writing Promotional Messages",
    "body": "2020/09/17 - 7 Tips for Writing Promotional Messages: Your online presence is based on strong promotional messages that you’re sending to your target audience. Whether you’re a blogger trying to build a career or a company with hundreds of clients, your marketing messages need to be on point. Everything you write and publish online is a promotional message. From social media posts to CTAs in the email you send. That’s why you need to learn how to write them. If you want to master writing promotional messages, we’ve got your back. The guide below provides 7 best tips on writing promotional messages, so just keep reading. Let’s take it one step at a time. 1. Set a Clear, Unique Goal: For each promotional message you’re trying to write, you have to know why you’re writing it. There needs to be one clear goal in order to make the message pop up in the sea of other promotional messages. So, before you start writing it, ask yourself the following question:  What effect do I want to achieve with this promotional message?There can be dozens of goals you can set:  sell a product get more traffic on your website promote an event or webinar communicate with your target audience get feedbackWhatever your goal is, set it before you start writing. Focus on a single goal to make the message as effective as possible. 2. Focus on a Target Group: Who are you writing these promotional messages to?  That’s the question you need to answer before you write and publish anything. Define your target audience and make sure that you know as much as possible about them, including:  their age sex location social status online behavior education level pain pointsMary Fincher, a content writer and editor at Grab My Essay, says: “Write with a target group in mind and wear their hat while you do it. This way, you’ll create stronger promotional messages that hit the right buttons. ”  3. Solve a Problem: If you know your target audience, you know what their pain points are. You know the problems they might be facing, and it’s your job to identify those problems and offer a solution. Let’s say you’re an e-commerce selling natural beauty products. Your promotional message could be:  Are you tired of using skincare products that irritate and damage your sensitive face skin? Don’t worry, because we’ve got a line of organic facial care products that suit even the most sensitive skin types!Like in the example above, your promotional message needs to:  identify the pain point offer a solution promise positive resultsThis way, you’re showing your target audience you know exactly how they feel or what they need, and that makes your message even stronger. 4. Use CTAs:   A call-to-action (CTA) is another powerful asset that you should be using to make your promotional messages memorable and actionable. CTAs are short but imperative messages that urge your target audience to take the steps you want them to take. CTAs should be placed at the end of your promotional messages to give them that final touch. Here’s a couple of examples:  Head to our webshop to order your free samples today! Sign up for the webinar today, and you’ll get a 10% discount.  Stop wondering, “Who could write me a dissertation?” Head to our website and find your writer today!It’s always a great idea to turn CTAs into clickable links or buttons that lead straight to the page where the desired action can be completed. 5. Play the FOMO card: Fear of missing out (FOMO) is a well known psychological phenomenon that marketers in all industries love to use. It’s based on the concept that people don’t like to miss out on things, especially if you put some pressure on them. That’s why in your promotional messages, you need to use elements that:  create a sense of urgency place an expiration date on the offer require immediate actionHere’s an example:  Your coupon expires today at 1 pm! Sprint to your favorite webshop and use your special discount!If people feel like they have to make a decision right now or else they might lose something, you did a great job. 6. Use Simple Language: Have you ever heard of cognitive fluency? It’s a concept in psychology that stands for the ease with which we interpret messages or understand the content. Cognitive fluency says that the simpler the messages, the more believable and memorable they are. Here’s how to apply it to your promotional messages:  use simple, everyday language avoid technical vocabulary use simple and easy to read fonts use a simple, non-confusing design use short sentencesThe easier you make it for your readers to read the promotional message, the easier they’ll accept it and believe it. So, make it simple but to the point. Be concise but create powerful messages. 7. Use Powerful Language: Your promotional messages need to be impactful and powerful. They need to help you win over new audience members or sell your new products. That’s why you need to make them strong. Use powerful language that includes:  active voice action verbs power wordsGo ahead and create impactful messages that will captivate your audience and create impressive feedback for your business. See what we just did there? If you need any help with making your messages even better, check out Classy Essay or Readable. Make sure your promotional messages are strong and powerful so that you ensure your target audience responds to them the way you want them to.   Final Thoughts: Writing promotional messages is a task that requires some strategizing and planning. The best thing you can do is to develop a strategy of your own and stick to it for all your future promotional messages. Use the tips we’ve shared above to write killer promotional messages that get your audience going.   [author] [author_image timthumb=’on’]https://katebagoy. com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Erica-Sunarjo. jpg[/author_image] [author_info]Erica Sunarjo is a professional writer and editor with a Master’s degree in Marketing and Social Media.

    "title": "How to Incorporate Traditional and Digital Marketing",
    "body": "2020/09/04 - In our day and age, marketing has many avenues that could be pursued. While there are still many wonderful forms of traditional media that can be utilized, digital marketing is on the rise. Both forms of marketing have their merits, but together they can do so much more. Unify Messages Across Mediums: In order to use multiple forms of marketing well, you need to make sure they all present the same message. You may be using a combination of social media, websites, flyers, billboards and more and they should all be consistent. If your marketing is not consistent, it can be confusing to your target audience as they will not know what is the most current or accurate information. Having a consistent message across all mediums demonstrates control and preparedness. You will look more reliable and dependable. Your audience will be able to trust your information and they would be more likely to use your product or services over someone who isn’t as quick to update all their mediums. Direct Mail: Direct mail is a cost-effective strategy for generating leads for your business. First of all, direct mail is very flexible as you can mail out brochures, postcards, coupons, and more. It’s also very individualized. It can be addressed to specific people, while containing the same message for all. Using direct mail usually means you have information from a mailing list of people who already use products or services similar to yours. This ensures that those who receive your advertisements are already interested. While direct mail already has many benefits on its own, it can be improved by combining it with digital marketing. For example, you can add QR codes to your mail that will direct people to your website. In your mail, you can also include deals that people can only redeem by going online. Overall, direct mail can be used to greatly increase your online traffic. Maintain a Balance: You don’t want to go too heavily one way or the other. It may seem like a good idea to put most of your efforts into online marketing as this seems to be the more popular form of media at the moment. However, online marketing targets a small portion of the population leaving many markets untapped. Make sure you have a good balance of both online and offline media in order to reach as many people as possible. As you market your business, consider implementing both traditional and digital media. Putting them together can help you maintain a strong message and reach multiple markets. Keep a balance and see what works best for you and your business. Ready to start your 6-figure business?

    "title": "3 Effective Ways to Improve Your Customer Service",
    "body": "2020/08/11 - Businesses large and small rely heavily on customer service. It’s not usually what gets customers and clients in the door the first time, but it’s often what keeps them coming back. Sometimes all it takes is one negative customer service experience to lose a client forever. If your business is struggling in the customer service department, it’s in your best interest to fix it. But how do you do this? Get Feedback: Your clients are your business’s customer service experts. Getting feedback from the clients themselves is arguably the best way to get an understanding of what your business is doing well and what needs improvement. Once you’ve identified what needs to be addressed, you can begin to take action towards improving your customer service. There are multiple ways to get feedback. You can send out customer or client surveys through email or if you have their phone numbers you can text them a link to a survey. Using text-based survey software has many benefits. Most people read texts pretty quickly, and the added convenience of using a phone is often appealing to customers. Just make sure your survey is formatted for mobile devices. If not, you’ll probably receive far fewer survey responses. Have Good Communication: Improving the communications you have with your clients is another good way to improve your customer service. For your part, communication should be clear, concise, and correct. You don’t want to be overly technical, confusing, or inaccurate in what you tell clients. Clients will also appreciate you communicating with them using their preferred method of communication. With the overabundance of robocalls and spam calls, people are less interested in you calling them on the phone. If your communication is not in person, they are more likely to prefer texts or emails. These are less intrusive methods of reaching out that cater to the client’s desire for convenience. On the other hand, if they are calling you, they’ll probably want to talk to an actual person, rather than an automated voice response. Team Training: Of course, if your team is on the customer service front lines, you need to make sure they are well-trained in customer service protocol. Providing excellent customer service requires certain skills that take time and practice to develop. If your team needs to brush up on these skills, hold training sessions that educate them and give them an opportunity to practice in a controlled environment. After training,  observe your team and follow up with them on their progress and how they’re doing. This may seem far down the line, but many freelance businesses bloom into well-established teams and this is a skill that can fall through the cracks. Businesses need to have excellent customer service. It’s an essential part of what turns one-time client into your best regulars. Work to improve your customer service by getting feedback from your existing clients, learn to communicate with them better, and train your team to deliver customer service excellence. These steps will help you wow them and keep them coming back again and again for more. Want to learn more great tips about how to run your own business? Grab my top secrets here! "

    "body": "2020/08/04 - As a business owner, it’s important to plan for emergencies, should they arise. While it’s impossible to predict the future and absolutely guarantee your business survives an economic crisis, there are strategies you can use to significantly increase the odds of survival for your business. Focus on Lead Generation: You can greatly increase your chances of success in business by focusing on marketing and lead generation. While marketing does cost money, you should not abandon your marketing efforts in the middle of an economic crisis. LinkedIn can be responsible for up to 80 percent of your B2B social media leads. Investing in marketing and lead generation will allow you to target your desired customers, generate brand awareness through educating your target market about your products, and increase your sales. Focusing on lead generation can help you build relationships with potential customers and clients, and convert these leads into actual customers. Review Your Business Model: Facing an economic crisis is a great opportunity to review your business model and decide what changes you need to make in order to make sure your business survives. Take some time to evaluate the best, most effective aspects about your business, as well as the less effective ones. While an economic crisis is never desirable, it can provide a useful catalyst that will promote change and adaptation to the current market. Change is necessary for the success of any business, so seize this chance to innovate and take your business to the next level. Reviewing your business model will help you streamline your operating processes, deliver better services, and find new ways to satisfy customers. Provide Real Value: When money is tight for you, it’s also tight for your customers, so you’ll need to find ways to increase the value of the products you sell in order to persuade your customers to continue buying from you. Common ways of providing value include offering discounts and using loyalty programs. You can also provide real value by sharing your expertise through posting relevant content. If you are unsure how to provide better value to your customers, you should try studying the reviews of your products as well as those of your competitors. Researching reviews is a great way to tap into the minds of your customers and find out what they like and dislike about the product and service you’re selling. As you prepare to recession-proof your business, make sure to focus on lead generation, review your business model, and find ways to provide real value to your customers. These three strategies will help ensure your business survives and give it the strength it needs to weather any storm. Looking for strategies to run your consulting business?

    "body": "2020/07/28 -   From the ever-changing universe of promotion, companies are always on the watch for new and innovative tactics to market their goods to a broader audience. Occasionally, service-centric businesses find themselves missed in a sea full of organizations advertising products. Well, in other words, the advertising and marketing for service businesses is not a simple feat. The most apparent problem is the absence of physical signs - how can you market something that isn’t concrete? How can you convince a person to spend their money and time on an item they cannot see or sense? The grey region, which lies between promoting the invisible, is precisely where the significant problem of the promotion world is different. But to make the procedure for marketing promising and thoughts a bit easier, we have compiled five great tips that’ll create any service-selling company on the thrones of succeeding. But before we get into that, let us discuss why you want to advertise a services company differently compared to your regular run-of-the-mill merchandise enterprise. Why should you promote a service business differently? Possibly the most essential error service sellers can be to use the very same methods used to market businesses with goods. If you are attempting to persuade a client to purchase your service, the gold word you want to keep within your thoughts is ‘trust’. In regards to advertising a service, customers have to be confident of the fact on which they can depend on you because a service cannot be returned when it ends up to be faulty. When things go awry, the first investment the consumer made goes rancid, and any odds of fostering a healthier customer-supplier connection visit waste. To stop mad clients from destroying any glimmer to your company to create it in the professional services sector, attempt to instil in mind the simple fact that service-based companies need different advertising approaches. Bearing in mind the energy these principles keep, we have compiled seven excellent methods to advertise a services company, starting with delivering a visible message.  Send a transparent marketing messageWhile thinking up ideas to advertise a services company, attempt to become as clear as you can with the information you want to convey. If it comes to marketing solutions, many small business owners and entrepreneurs find themselves surrounded by an arsenal of ideas and views, which direct them to neglect to devote to a single. The leading information a service-vendor can get would be to pick a fresh yet straightforward concept to ship via a marketing effort. A vital characteristic of your promotion campaign needs to be to make a vibrant experience for any possible consumer. To gratify, a person is experiencing the support you provide. Consider producing ads that highlight the way your service works to relieve pain factors and extend comfort. The main challenge for you since the service seller lies in developing a persuasive experience that instantly captures the eye of almost any prospects. When the message is determined, many service-vendors use an assortment of advertising methods to market their articles, concentrating on turning prospects to clients. The most often encountered issues faced by firms range from generate organic visitors to procuring the best executive patrons, as shown below: Picture Source: https://www. hubspot. com/hs-fs/hubfs/SOI-blog-top-challenges4-1. png?width=1320&amp;name=SOI-blog-top-challenges4-1. png The ads that you send out are not the sole thing that bears witness for a marketing message. By now that you interact with customers to a job as subliminal as the site’s colour palette, they all are critical contributors to receiving your advertising message around.  Find a way to make your company stand outTo illustrate what this means to create your service-centric company stand out, let us think about an example. Envision a guy called X who is in desperate need of advertising services to advertise his articles. But after going through hundreds of sites and testimonials, X continues to perform the task himself, because nothing that he came around had caught his attention. Regrettably, most clients share the same debate as X, together with a lot of services advertised at precisely the same dull and predictable manner. With that said, many service-vendors find it hard to differentiate themselves from their competitors. That’s why every time a comprehensive self-analysis is useful. Service-based companies have to compare themselves to their competitors’ advertising plans and invent a list of gaps that make them stand out from most. I additionally suggest that you create precisely the Value Proposition Canvas along with the Business model Canvas that will help to comprehend the clients too.   In the future, a service-centric firm must base its key advertising message on which sets them apart from the contest. The medium of the movie may also put you alone, while raising earnings since most customers prefer rapid videos, rather than reading a booklet.  Picture Resource: https://blog. hubspot. com/hs-fs/hubfs/video-content-demand-consumers. png?width=692&amp;name=video-content-demand-consumers. png   Make use of social networkingAlong with creating a site for your business, look at generating company profiles and pages on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, along with some other social websites you find appropriate. Once your pages are all installed, be sure to remain on top of these by responding to client queries and posting relevant and valuable updates. This can allow you to build a next. And even in the event, the immediate recipient of your societal websites marketing is not buying what you are selling; they can nevertheless, readily share your supply with somebody they know.    Concentrate on increasing significance for the clientsIf you are a service-vendor, get one thing right. Your work is to market value, not cost! Unlike product entrepreneurs, that compete mainly on cost, advertising a services company depends on worth. While searching for promotion strategies and thoughts, attempt to concentrate on increasing value for the clients, instead of mindlessly decreasing the purchase price of the service that you provide. Additionally, any company that offers a service less costly than its rivals is generally regarded as the group’s black sheep. A simple and efficient way of increasing clients’ significance would be to package a couple of services jointly, which functions as the top choice for lowering your cost. Many service-centric organizations unite an arsenal of helpful attributes and amplify the significance of customers and treat them like real individuals rather than numbers.  Picture Source: https://c1. sfdcstatic. com/content/dam/web/en_us/www/images/research/connected-customer/customer-expectations-hit-all-time-highs-2-mobile. jpg The enjoyable thing about raising value for clients is how creative you are with it. Additionally, how you add value may also help differentiate your business from the contest. Alternative ways to add value to services include:  Increasing delivery speed.  Providing customers with expert opinion/advice.  Improving the customer care you offer.  Link Together with the communityBe kind to your neighbours, and also do not approach your neighbourhood with the obsolete” competitive edge” business design. Other recognized regional companies have their particular clientele. Therefore, if you handle these businesses in regard, and because they might be unable to manage a specific sum of clients, then they might only refer some clients for the services. A promising means to get in touch with your community is to participate at the regional Rotary Club or Chamber of Commerce. These assemblies may hook you up with other companies that adopt mutual interaction.    Carefully update your marketing planThis stage might appear redundant, but assessing and upgrading each part of an organization’s marketing plan is your first stepping stone to victory. A successful advertising strategy does not revolve around the way you advertise your support; it slips deep into each nook and cranny of this procedure. A promotion strategy amalgamates the objectives you’ve got for your business with all the actions you take to reach them. Many newly-found companies make the mistake of etching their advertising strategy on into the rock. As the advertising world about you evolves, your marketing strategy must evolve with this. Attempt to re-evaluate your marketing plan as far as you can, bear in mind the targets that you set to attain would be SMART: Picture Resource: https://www. tutor2u. net/_legacy/blog/files/blog-marketingobjectives-150110. gif  Work on enhancing existing customer relationshipsProbably the vital aspect of marketing service-based companies is that the selling is not complete in the cash counter. Unlike businesses selling goods, you have to be there for the long term when marketing services, including delivery and client care. A straight forward suggestion to keep beneath your sleeve would be to enhance existing customer connections regularly. As a general guideline, customers who are held happy over a while would be the driving force behind an organization’s success. What’s more, catering to present customers promotes a company to expand its solutions and think of new applications to amuse them. Improving present customer relations additionally yields more revenue compared to advertising to prospects. Thus, where can you go from here?

    "body": "2020/07/03 - Setting up a business is exciting! However, there are many steps you need to take before you can hit the ground running. Here are a few general guidelines to help you in the process of building your business’ foundation as you set it up. Building an Identity : You’ll need to develop a brand for your company, including aspects such as a business name, logo, a color scheme, and more. What are your goals as a company? What do you want your company to communicate to others? How do you want to represent yourself? Research your target audience. How can you best appeal to them? What will draw their eye? What do they want? Then, define your business’s niche. What will you have that other companies don’t? Make sure you specify branding guidelines and rules in order to maintain consistency. Registering the Company: Registering your company is another key step in creating your own business. In order to do so, first, choose a business structure. This will affect how you file taxes, as well as the risk to your personal assets should your business ultimately fail. Then, decide the location of your business—what address will you use for filing taxes, opening a bank account for your business, and receiving government documents? You may need to register your business at the federal, state, and local level, depending on where you live, so be sure to look up the applicable regulations. You will also need to apply for required licenses and permits before you can begin doing business. All of this can come with some expense, and different fees may apply depending on your state and business structure. Planning Your Finances: Although setting up your business might not involve a lot of money right away, it will require some level of initial investment. You’ll need to plan out how your company is going to cover expenses until you can start making a profit. Plan out a summary of estimated one-time startup costs—permits, equipment, legal fees, inventory, insurance, branding expenses, any property leases, etc. Don’t forget to include any expenses from registering your company. Then add on how much your business will cost to run for the first 12 months, including salaries. This final rough figure represents the initial investment. You can fund your business in many ways, including financing, loans, grants, investors, crowdfunding, and even bootstrapping. Setting up a business is a complex, involved process. Focusing first on the basics, building an identity, registering your company, and planning your finances, will get you off to a strong start. Ready to start your online consulting business?

    "body": "2020/06/26 - When your business is in growth mode, it’s important to evaluate different aspects of your business, such as your target audience and determine how those factors can help you achieve your goals. You need to pinpoint the small facets that help complete the big picture. A good place to start is with your target audience. Knowing who your target audience is and understanding their needs can help your business thrive. Tracking Interactions: Tracking customers within the bounds of appropriate, ethical business is essential for the growth of your company. It is basically the only way you can truly analyze what is working and what isn’t working about your marketing strategies. Luckily, there are so many different ways you can track customer interactions. First, try website analytics. According to Optimizely, this tool allows you to measure the traffic of your website and where this traffic is coming from. It also supplies your data analysts with information about the marketing tactics that are clicked on most often, and which ones more commonly lead to sales. Second, you will want to implement ad network conversion tracking to let you see who is finding your brand through ads on the internet. This data will get you one step closer to figuring out who your target audience is and what market strategies are successful. Marketing Segmentation: Marketing segmentation is a key technique to better optimizing your marketing strategy. Basically, it is a method of research that allows for you to target certain audiences by dividing customers into sub-categories according to certain demographics or characteristics. According to Podium, the most common ways audiences are segmented are by their life cycle stage, the amount they spend, by their geographic location, and by the level of their engagement. It is highly recommended that you use this technique when identifying how to best target certain audiences. Conduct Surveys: After using marketing segmentation and interaction tracking to identify your audience, you will want to get to know this audience as well as you can. One of the best ways to do this is to conduct surveys. While not everybody is willing to fill out a survey, any small amount of information you can get from your customers is helpful. According to UX Booth, make sure your surveys are short and easy to understand. Be willing to gain honest criticism—as it will help you grow as a company. Ask customers about your products or services and whether they got the help they needed. One of the greatest mistakes business owners make is marketing before actually knowing their target audience. If you don’t know your audience, then you won’t know how to best market to them. By tracking information, using marketing segmentation, and conducting surveys you will have most of the information you need to be successful and help your business grow.

You should be proud of your products and hard work even when you’re hardly working. The truth is that no customer looks forward to an unwanted approach of someone trying to sell them products for a personal gain. Here are a few ways for representing your brand in public and let your creative genius speak for itself. Conduct: Have you ever set your heart on a product or service only to find the person selling it is truly unlikable? Conduct goes a long way when searching for potential buyers. Take your mother’s advice and pay attention to your manners in public, especially when you’re representing your brand. Another crucial thing business owners and employees overlook is their social media presence. It’s so easy to look up a brand, and past social media posts can come back to haunt you. Consider deleting all potentially controversial posts, keeping your personal and professional profiles separate, or sticking to social media solely to promote your brand. Appearance: No matter how formal or informal your brand is, it’s important to present yourself in a good light. If you’re wearing your brand of clothing in public, make sure it’s clean so that people won’t be afraid to approach you and ask you where you got it. Those in the beauty industry in particular need to be conscious of how they present themselves. An aesthetician might get her lashes filled every 3 weeks to keep her lashes full and better represent her beauty business. Hairdressers should keep their color fresh and style immaculate. Makeup artists should also put effort into how they do their face so they can steer curious complimenting customers right to their shop door. Create Relationships: On your days off, you might have a few favorite hangouts where you go to catch up with friends and unwind. By creating relationships with waitstaff, baristas and bartenders, you can promote your brand in your own comfort zone by simply being your best friendly self. Instead of pushing your brand, try friendly conversation with other patrons and the staff itself. Who knows, you might be invited to showcase your wares at their next promotional event. Your brand should represent you wherever you go. Let your new customers see what you’re about both publicly and personally, and they will be more likely to join your cause. Want to up your brand?

    "body": "2020/05/25 - Looking for Marketing Techniques to Grow Your Business?The biggest wish of any entrepreneur is to see their business grow. After all, why else would you invest your time, talent, resources, and effort into something if you don’t want to see it succeed? Getting your fledgling company off the ground isn’t an easy task, and it can take a lot of hard work and dedication to grow your business or startup. There are many paths to success, and some of them are easier or more evident than others. In a previous post, we talked about ‘How to Create a Business Website for Big Impact’ through creating engaging content and interacting with your market using social media. Managing an online presence is one way to ensure that you’re reaching the customers you want to reach, but it isn’t the only avenue available to you. Many entrepreneurs are understandably hesitant about relying on offline marketing techniques in order to push their growth further. After all, offline marketing can be labor-intensive and put a drain on resources that many starting businesses may not have. However, integrating your marketing strategy to include both offline and online methods might actually help you generate a bigger impact and benefit your business in the long run. Here are a few low-cost ideas you can use to supplement your online marketing work in the offline world.   Direct Mail: Many people don’t think too deeply about direct mail, but it’s a familiar part of daily life. You’ve probably had the same experience of opening up mail to find coupons and other promotional materials from businesses. Direct mail isn’t always first on the list when it comes to small business marketing strategies, but they can actually be extremely useful, especially if you want to see returns. Triadex Services’ post on direct mail suggests this marketing technique actually has some of the highest conversion rates, with 65% of all consumers making a purchase. While direct mail will require you to invest in materials, postage, and a targeted mailing list, it’s also one of the best methods to create actual ROI and engagement with your website and business. Companies big and small get great returns from direct mail marketing, so it might be a good idea to give it a try.    Media Giveaways: Giving out freebies may seem like it’s counterintuitive — after all, you’re literally giving out your product or service for free — but many small business owners often underestimate the impact these giveaways can have on potential customers. Ideas 4 Smallbiz suggests that giving away freebies can actually create a buzz and positive brand association, something that can be hard to do in a saturated online sphere. You can use giveaways to strengthen recall of your brand, and include links to your social media and website in your free items. While it can be costly to do this with a large number of people, giveaways are more likely to motivate customers to engage with your brand and create lasting relationships with your company. Canvassing: Canvassing can be a little daunting for beginner entrepreneurs, but it’s an integral part of marketing. The point of canvassing is not to close a sale necessarily, but to promote your brand, especially among people who you might not be able to reach through online channels.   Young Upstarts has a list of different tips you can use to make your canvassing efforts more effective, including making your pitch compelling and creative. This is where your soft skills as a business owner come in — you’ll need to make sure that your canvassing “script” is engaging and personable, and aim to build deeper relationships with your potential customers. Make sure to make full use of your charisma, and redirect your target market to online platforms where they can learn more about your brand. Networking: Finally, one of the best, low-cost offline marketing methods a small business owner can use is networking. Networking can be labor-intensive, and starting out can get a little shaky, but it’s a technique that you can use continuously over the lifespan of your business, with great returns in the long-term. It can help you build confidence, forge connections with potential customers as well as partner businesses, and identify benchmarks and best practices in the industry. But while networking has a slew of different advantages, it’s also something that many small business owners might struggle with. Luckily, All Business has put together seven easy tips to help small business owners get started with networking, including building a strategy and writing out an elevator pitch that can help attract new customers to your business. Networking is an important skill that all entrepreneurs need to invest in, and can pull in huge returns over the years when done correctly.   Want more ways to market your business?

There’s no doubt about it. For many aspiring entrepreneurs, the reality of just how difficult it is to start and run your own business can hit rather quickly. When you start a new business, you are taking a great risk, both financially and emotionally. It is so important that you prepare yourself for the various hurdles that you are no doubt going to face. Here are some of the biggest hurdles you should think about and get over if you are going to succeed as a business owner in the long run. Startup Costs: No matter the industry you get into, the cost of starting a business will certainly be high. Fortunately, there are various ways to fund your business if you don’t have the deepest pockets just yet. You may opt-in for a traditional business loan, but you should be prepared to be highly vetted by your bank, especially if you have no experience running a business. Other methods include selling pre-orders or seeking funds from investors. Others include government-backed loans that come with great benefits. The SBA can provide loans to business owners that are backed by the federal government. Fear of Failure: There’s no doubt that placing your reputation and funds on the line to create a business is certainly a very scary situation to get yourself into. However, it is paramount that you remove this fear of failure as soon as possible. Constantly thinking about what may or may not happen will cause you to miss opportunities or avoid taking the necessary risks to grow your company. The best way to begin to remove this fear is to be confident in your choices. When a risky move needs to be made, you should research the decision as much as possible, thus reducing the amount of hesitation and fear associated with it. Taking Ownership: The reality is that when you are running a business, the buck stops with you. It’s important to take ownership of your business, and that includes taking ownership of your mistakes. You cannot sustain a successful business by continuously blaming everyone else whenever something goes wrong. You should accept that things are going to go wrong and that taking responsibility to make things right is in the best interest of your business. If you’re thinking of starting your own company, understanding the difficulties of the process should be your first task. So if you’re ready to kick some ass and take your business challenges by the horns, consider the list above to ensure that you start your new company on the right foot.

    "body": "2020/04/22 - Why Should You Consider Building a Brand?: Building a brand is critical to the success of your small business. When implemented correctly, a good brand strategy  allows you to scale your service and offerings, acts a sales person for your business online, warms potential customers up to work with you and repels those clients from hell you don’t want to work with. There are quite a few components that go into building a brand image. Below are three of the most important yet easiest criteria to tackle. Brand Values: Your brand values are beliefs or morals that you and your company abide by. They serve as the map work for the operation of your company. Without clearly stated values, along with full compliance in operating under these values, your brand’s image can become lost to consumers as well as employees. Another reason brand values are important is because of customer retention. Many consumers flock to a brand because the brand’s values align with their own. Not only does this boost your bottom line, but it sears your brand image into their minds. Consistency: According to Harvey Agency, consistency across the board is critical when it comes to branding your business, especially since it only takes a single second for customers to create an impression of your brand and about 5–7 impressions for your brand to become recognizable and memorable. Your brand should be consistent across the board from your logo, including colors, to your advertisements. You’ll need to remember to align branding with your values because that goes along with consistency. Don’t forget about your employees; their uniforms, attitudes, and motivations should all be consistent across the board, too. Social Media: The world has entered a time period in which social media can make or break a company, according to Pretty Links. It’s no longer only about carving out your company’s section in social media. Now more than ever people can share every moment and you can believe that will include interactions with your business. As you can imagine, in these shareable moments, your brand’s image should shine through. For one thing, it’s free advertising. For another, information through social media travels a lot faster than word of mouth, which used to be the fastest form of advertisement. The perfect sharable moment with consistent branding can catapult your company to the top when it comes to consumer approval. With a little effort, you can begin building your brand image easily. The three tips above aren’t complicated to implement but can have tremendous results on branding. By aligning your brand with your values, staying consistent, and using social media to your advantage, you’ll set your branding efforts up for success.

    "body": "2020/04/15 - Why Isn’t Your Business Growing Anymore?: We all want our business to be successful and continue to grow, but sometimes we just hit a wall and everything just grinds to a halt. For one reason or another, profit growth has tapered off, and your operation is stagnating. Your numbers aren’t tanking, but they’re not growing either, they’re just kind of in limbo. This can happen for a number of key reasons, and many of them are internal problems, but not necessarily with how your workers are functioning or your employees’ performance. You Need to Change Your Marketing: Marketing is essential for optimizing business growth, and while keeping consistent with your brand image is important, sometimes it’s important to take a fresh new approach to your marketing strategies. Stale marketing could lead to consumers losing interest in your brand and moving on unless your service or goods are strong enough to sell by word of mouth or on quality alone. It’s a good idea to generate a yearly marketing plan to set goals for your business each year. This will make sure your marketing stays fresh and your business keeps growing. Supply Capacity: Sales are only half of the equation when it comes to profitability. While your goal is to make more sales, you can only sell what products you’re able to produce. Sometimes your sales stagnate not due to a lack of demand, but from an inability to keep up with that demand. This can be due to either not having the resources to produce enough supply to keep up with it or production issues that are preventing optimal efficiency. The 8 Disciplines problem-solving method can be applied to a variety of problems, but it works especially well here, as it can identify where your problem is and where to focus your efforts. 8D is a good process for solving problems if you do think the issues are on your end. Keep Up With Technology: While tradition is a good thing to have when performing business, as it gives people a sense of loyalty and stability, you shouldn’t let that tradition hold your company back from advancing. If your competitors are using the latest technology to help serve their customers more efficiently, you’ll naturally be at a disadvantage. Also, as older forms of technology become more outdated, or worse yet less secure, your customers may question your business if you still prioritize the use of antiquated technology. Keep these three factors in mind when analyzing your business and trying to optimize business growth. While there are other things that can affect business growth, these three points will ensure the basics are covered. I can put you on the path to a 6-figure business.

    "title": "Why Technology Is Key to Business Growth",
    "body": "2020/04/13 - Launching and owning your own business is a great way of moving toward financial freedom while providing products or services that are currently in-demand. If you run a business, understanding why technology is key to growth and expansion is essential to prevent you from missing out on potential opportunities and losing sales to competitors who are using that technology to their own advantage. With the right technology, it is possible to grow a business in any niche industry or market. Automation Is the Future: Automation is an integral part of tech and the future we have been creating for ourselves, both personally and professionally. With the use of AI, marketing automation and automated services, maximizing your online reach as a business or brand has become easier and more achievable than ever. Automation is not only apparent when ordering food online or using an app on your smartphone, but it is also applied in chatbots and marketing campaign strategies. Using automation with your online marketing strategy is a great way to monitor and track trends, keywords, phrases and even sentiments you are interested in honing in on. Automation can reduce the demands on labor and provide you with more time to spend on customer service and the quality of your products, services or content. It will free your critical personnel from mundane tasks and allow them to focus on the big picture. Modern Businesses Need Technology: Regardless of size, most businesses need technology to remain afloat, relevant and up to date with the latest ways to reach customers. Even small mom-and-pop, brick-and-mortar shops typically rely on technology these days to keep their businesses up and running efficiently. Whether you are investing in a point of sale (POS) system or developing an online marketing strategy to drive foot or online traffic to your store, technology is essential. According to Straight Edge IT, most of the common softwares require some fundamental understanding in order to use them properly, which is why it is important as an owner or entrepreneur to familiarize yourself with the technology that is most valuable to your type of business. Even if you only operate a local store, the more familiar you become with the technology that is commonly used in your industry, the easier it will be to transition into using those technological tools for the benefit of your own business and your brand. Adapting to New Tech Gives You an Edge: When you decide to keep up with the latest technology released into the business and retail world (both online and off), you gain a competitive edge over alternate companies in the market who choose to steer clear of technological advances. If you are able to offer your prospective customers products, services, features and functions that your competitors are not, you are much more likely to generate sales and revenue. Rather than turning away from it, embracing technology and choosing to adapt to it instead can ultimately bolster your brand’s image and reputation while simultaneously generating greater revenue. It Exposes You to New Markets: Choosing to embrace changes and new developments by implementing new technologies for the benefit of your customers is a great way to expose yourself to new markets that might have otherwise been ignored or lost. Without the use of technology, expanding your reach internationally or online has become increasingly difficult, if not impossible, in today’s competitive marketplace. Integrating new technologies and reaching out to new and untapped markets provides more potential revenue streams and future opportunities for even greater expansion and growth. Security: According to Fire Eye, over 77% of all cyber crimes target small and midsize businesses, and yet, 42% of those businesses don’t see cyber crime as a risk. Cyber security plays a major role in determining how individuals shop online and where they place their trust when it comes to brands and corporations. Using technology is a great way to implement additional security measures into your e-commerce storefront and online presence, further protecting the data and information of your online users and prospective customers. Scaling: Scaling your business for expansion is an essential part of survival, especially if you are competing for your place in a competitive free market. If you want to grow your business over time, scaling is much easier with technology. Implementing technology is one of the greatest ways to gain access to tools, software and marketing programs that can help to take your enterprise to the next level. Whether you are the owner of a local mom-and-pop store or an online-only brand, you can employ technology to help promote and market your business while also creating and cultivating relationships with your current followers, fans and loyal customers. Using technology, including marketing solutions, advertising networks and analytics programs, furnishes valuable insight into the demands of your target audience while also providing you with more opportunity to pinpoint which campaigns are most likely to result in favorable outcomes. Training Programs: According to Convergence Training, you don’t have to train employees in-person anymore — learning management software can do the job for you. Developing efficient training programs for your employees is much easier with the use of technology than it would be through traditional methods of implementing long-term, in-person training for each individual you employ. Using a virtual or online training program also presents you with more opportunity to hire individuals who work remotely in a different state, or even in a different country entirely, allowing you a much larger talent pool. Relevance: Without relevance and a purpose, businesses and brands struggle to thrive and, ultimately, even survive. Through the use of technology, you can maintain the relevance of your brand without sacrificing your objectives and goals. A range of technologies, including AI, chatbots, marketing programs, analytics software and even social media, can help you to maintain your company’s relevance. The more relevant and current you appear to your target audience and the demographics you intend to reach, the easier it becomes to generate sales and increase your overall ROI. Even if you don’t have plans to expand globally in the immediate future, understanding the role that technology plays in business growth is extremely important. When you grasp why technology is key to business growth, you will always feel prepared and ready to take on any challenges you encounter. Embracing technology will help you keep your enterprise relevant and successful. Let me show you how to get to revenue quickly so you don’t screw up your finances. Get my top secrets here. "

    "body": "2020/04/09 - How can you create a business website for big impact? Here are three tips. Websites are virtually business requirements these days, as more and more people turn to the internet before making purchases. However, a simple website that lists your products in bullets isn’t enough. You have to create a sharp, well-designed business website that will keep customers’ attention and make it easy for them to find out what your business is all about. Create Engaging Content: The greatest asset you can capture from any potential customer is their attention and time, as this will ultimately lead to a sale. To that end, you have to create engaging content that will keep them scrolling, reading, and clicking. The definition of engaging content changes, depending on your industry, so this will require some legwork first: What sorts of content can you create that will keep a customer coming back for more? Keep It up to Date: Old, out-of-date websites won’t cut it anymore, as the competition is far too fierce. In order for you to successfully create a good website, you have to ensure that it is up to date with current consumer tastes. This includes the layout of the website, graphical and design selections, and more. Furthermore, you should keep up with the changing standards of SEO on your website for maximum effectiveness. Some of the basics of SEO are relatively set, but websites like Google are constantly changing their algorithms in order to better reflect modern tastes. Your website must adjust to these changes. Incorporate Social Media: The vast majority of Americans use some form of social media on a regular basis. This means that incorporating social media into your overall business plans is essentially a business requirement. You should always remember that the goal of social media is to get more people to know your business and increase your sales. While content cannot be overly sales-oriented, you should keep in mind that you are trying to steer people back to your website with social media. Furthermore, the content you create on your website should have share buttons, making it easy for people who like what you are producing to share it on social media. Websites are expected from most businesses these days, but they are only effective if you actually use them properly. If you follow the above tips, you will be well on your way towards creating a business website that can help increase your sales. Do you need some help getting your business moving?

    "title": "3 Tips for Creating a Winning Marketing Strategy",
    "body": "2020/04/05 - Crafting a Winning Marketing StrategyOne of the best things you can do for your small business is to craft and implement a winning marketing strategy. Having the right program in place provides you with the ability to obtain the necessary data to take your business to the next level. However, before you can accomplish this, you must fill in the blanks with some essential information. The following list includes three tips to help you get to that very goal. Identify Your Wants: A common issue when it comes to identifying what a company wants to achieve is either being too unrealistic or not being ambitious enough about their goals. Thus, it is important to carefully understand where your company wants to be in the next quarter, year, and five years. This can only be done by accessing the situation carefully and understanding what you can realistically achieve within that time period. Doing so will place you on the right route where you are targeting the right amount of people as well as the right type of people. Find Your Target: There is nothing worse than spending valuable time and funds targeting the wrong audience. This is why it is paramount that your targeting is on point before launching your marketing strategy onto the community. In this pursuit, consumer insights could be helpful in identifying what you have. This essentially breaks down to figuring out if the right situation is present to acquire valuable customers as well as a healthy level of competition where you can still thrive. If the opportunity is there, then you may begin to question people, measure responses, and narrow it down to the target audience you are going to be using for your marketing campaign. Find Your Voice: Your voice is what customers are going to know you for, and thus it should fit the type of business you are running. For example, a law firm should utilize a professional voice throughout their marketing campaigns to ensure their clients they are dealing with someone who is a professional and will take their cases seriously. Note that it is also very important to keep this voice consistent throughout all your mediums. Creating the right marketing strategy for your company is an essential part of your long-term success. Thus, it is important to adhere to the list of tips posted above in order to create and follow through with a highly successful marketing strategy.

Now is NOT the time to stop selling. Now is NOT the time to panic. Maybe it’s time to pivot. Maybe it’s time to serve. Maybe it’s time to take a break and strategize a new path forward - but if you are in business, *it is your JOB to sell*. Especially if you have employees you are supporting! Should a business stop selling and fire all their employees? F*ck no. That’s far more irresponsible than stepping up and growing the business (or at least keeping doors open). There is nothing dirty, sleazy or wrong about selling. And if you’re selling something that people need, it’s actually a service! It’s a service of all Charmin employees to be getting up and going to work to make the TP. It’s a service for the truck drivers who are on the roads in spite of their own fear or health to get it to stores. It’s a service for supermarket employees to stay open and sell. And it’s a service opportunity for you to show up and help your clients. We are living in scary times and it’s easy to focus on the fear.

    "title": "How to Use LinkedIn to Generate Leads for your Small Business or Freelance Business",
    "body": "2020/03/04 - Want to Generate More Leads for Your Small Business or Find Clients for a Freelance Business?: It used to be the case that Linkedin was a hub for business professionals to connect and network for job opportunities and while this is still the case, it’s changed so much as a social media platform that there’s a whole new way to play the game now. Are you leveraging LinkedIn for your freelancing biz? Of course you have a profile and your information is filled, but are you using it to find clients? Like luring a dog with a bone, a well optimized LinkedIn profile will set you apart and attract potential work.   The good news is that you don’t have to invest in paid courses or advertisements for the most popular professional network to get results. In fact, you just need to make sure you follow a few basic rules. Here I am going to map these rules and why I am sure they will work for you.   Re contextualize what LinkedIn is:   Before we dive into the nitty gritty, it’s important that you have a good perception of LinkedIn. There are plenty of users who’ll only log in when it’s time to find a new client or a new job – essentially, like an electronic resume that’s there for the world to see. While it does offer this function, that definition gives a really limited scope for the platform. Instead of considering LinkedIn to be just about finding jobs, try to consider it simply as a professional social media tool – an enormous room full of people who are in work mode. When you look at it through this lens, there’s far more opportunity to be had than simply assuming it’s for paid-position job seekers.   Test different ‘About Me’ and ‘Headline’ copy:   It can feel daunting to approach writing a detailed “About Me” that outlines exactly what you can offer and what you’re looking for – but it doesn’t have to be extensive. Make sure to use good keywords in your headline, about me, skills, and experience; That way recruiters and people looking for freelancers can find you. Here’s a great article going over the 7 places in your LinkedIn you want to fill with relevant keywords. On top of keywords you’ll want to use your headline and about me to express yourself. You’re a creative amongst a sea of other creatives, you’d be wise to learn what makes you unique (Your Unique Value Proposition) and why what you offer is so much better than the shotty work you can get on upwork for $6. To figure out what works best will require some testing – you could try including your portfolio url in your about me, or squeeze some samples in to show your skills. Constantly update and revise the writing on your profile as you gain new experience and you’ll be sure to attract the right kind of work.   Connect with people:      Build a Solid Network of Connections:  Your net worth is tied to your network – Ever heard that saying? Well it’s true, your next gig could come from a connection that likes what you do. It’s important to network and mingle amongst the many professionals that will be your peers, colleagues and possibly clients. By connecting you’ll get to see more of what’s going on for those people, and they (and their connections) get to see more of what’s going on with you. So, connect with people. If it’s people you know that’s great – but don’t worry if it’s not. The very best way to grow your connections is to approach the people who you find yourself engaging with in your newsfeed. For instance, you’ve got a friend of a friend who comments on the same kind of stuff when it pops up on your mutual connection’s feed – why not ping them a connection request with a quick line that acknowledges how you seem to have the same views on things? – or how you’d like to get to know more about their industry/company/job role – etc. As long as you’re not trying to sell them something then you’ll find a large majority of people are totally fine with it.        Join Groups:  There’s plenty of groups on LinkedIn that you could join to help you grow your freelancing business. Groups on LinkedIn are a great source of industry info, business tips and overall connection with like minded people. You can join a group for finding job opportunities in your respective industry, stay up to date with what’s going on or support each other with tips and advice.   The key is to make sure that you’re using groups properly. For instance, if you’re a designer, it makes sense to join designer groups but don’t stop there. Think about joining groups that reflect the kind of industries you’d like to work in. So, let’s say you’re set on working in promotional ad design– why not join groups that are intended for event promoters for example. If you’re planning to use LinkedIn to find work, you’re unlikely to find it digitally socializing with like-minded folk. Instead, think about where your customers might hang out and put yourself there. For some great LinkedIn groups check out my post about the best groups to join for freelancers.      Recommend &amp; Endorse your connections:  When you’re connected with people, you’re going to win yourself a lot of friends if you make some recommendations. You don’t have to do the hard work here – just tag someone you think might be suitable for the job when you see a connection comment “can anyone put me in touch with a good…” What goes around comes around and the more you offer people up, the more they’ll do the same for you. Endorsing others for their top skills can also help build up your LinkedIn profile.      Create Content to Post:  It’s not something you need to do daily, but it’s really useful to create some engaging content on LinkedIn. What topic you decide on is entirely up to you. Have you got a side project you’re working on that you’d like to show off? Perhaps you’ve created something great for a client and you’d like to share your efforts? Maybe you just want to share a motivational quote or a good vibe from the week? If you’re a good writer, there’s plenty you can do here. LinkedIn articles are a great place to do some storytelling – an extremely powerful way of setting yourself apart from the crowd.  If you’re not sure exactly what I mean by ‘storytelling’ take a glance at this article. Whatever you decide to create, there’s plenty of space on LinkedIn for sharing your message. If you’re not sure, look at what kind of content you engage with on the platform and do something similar.   Build a Schedule you Can Keep:   It’s easy to forget all the background work you should be doing to ensure you’re doing enough marketing for your freelance business when the pressure is on with a project or job and your schedule is tight. LinkedIn falls into this category for many people – if it’s not producing results all the time, it’s easy to drop the ball when it comes to logging in and engaging. On that basis, it can be a really positive step to create a bit of an on-going schedule to help you upkeep your efforts. Break down what you need to do into the following lists:  Daily LinkedIn tasks Weekly LinkedIn tasks Monthly/occasional LinkedIn tasksIt’s a good idea for them to look like this:  Daily: Log in, engage with your newsfeed – like, comment, share, recommend Weekly: Create some content – a post, a graphic, a picture, etc Monthly: Change your profile up, join some groups, build your connectionsConsider using a scheduler to plan your content distribution ahead of time. With apps like Hootsuite and Buffer you can plan and schedule posts in advance to maintain your engagement. Having a schedule to adhere to can make a lot of the organizing needed to plan ahead much easier. This post was written with love in order to help you carve your own path in your freelancing journey.

    "body": "2020/03/04 - As a small business owner, you might think your LinkedIn profile is complete with a decent heading, about me and a blooming list of connections. However, are you truly taking advantage of everything LinkedIn has to offer? Rather than perusing through the Craigslist job board in your city - search and browse LinkedIn’s groups. There are groups for different industries, professional associations, alma matters and more. If for some reason there isn’t a group for what you’re working on, you can always create one!  I advise that before you join and start posting in any of these groups that you, at minimum, have a profile picture and your headline and about me filled. This’ll help you get accepted as well as help people interact with you. Leveraging groups is a super helpful way of not only growing your network but offers opportunities to immerse yourself within your industry of choice and create content you’re proud of. Make sure to post valuable information and pay it forward to your fellow freelancers and small business owners. Don’t simply focus on “me, me, me!”, when you offer something of value to others, they’ll be more willing to help you out in return. To get you started I’ve compiled a list of some LinkedIn groups dedicated to connecting freelancers and helping them scale their business’.

Here you can share your knowledge with other developers/designers, ask questions pertaining to various issues you come across or vent about anything business related causing stress. Here you can discuss and solve your troubling woes regarding the development of your projects at any stage or phase of it’s progress. If you are looking for freelance projects, you can find them here. Business people can also post their requirements for projects here.   Within this LinkedIn group you can build on your thoughts, grow on ideas and meet people of the same interest.   Freelance writers -  This is a group for networking within the freelance writing community. This applies to all fiction writers, journalists, copywriters, editorialists, ghost-writers etc.   This group is about networking and exchanging resources and ideas. Show your expertise by your commentary and not by self promotion, you’re a writer after all - show them what you can do! If you start a discussion with an attachment or blog, then please do so in an appropriate manner so members do not have to assume what it is you are discussing.   Try using a concise, related and catchy title if possible if you expect to grab attention - Then use the comments box to briefly explain the nature of your post and its BENEFITS to members or a question you may have. This helps keep things clear. By posting accordingly to the rules you accomplish two things: Provide an opportunity and courtesy to the members should they want to read it or simply ignore it. Secondly you will be using a marketing technique - should you follow the rules, to attract readership. This is a great way to increase your reach on LinkedIn.   Freelance graphic designers -  Freelance Graphic Designers is the “World’s Best Marketplace for Creative Talent”. This Community includes portfolios and detailed work profiles of Graphic Designers, Web Designers, Illustrators, Logo Designer, Art Directors, Flash Animators, Industrial Designers, Advertising Agencies, Copywriters, Photographer and Interactive Artists. Uniting designers and creatives from around the world, this group manages to craft an environment that can help nurture you during your journey of building a freelance business. You can get feedback on your portfolio or advice on how to deal with a specific issue. This is a must if you do any kind of illustration or design. Flexjobs -  FlexJobs is a group dedicated to helping people find the best fitting jobs. From Part-time to full-time, freelance to employee, remote to on-site… work flexibility can help support you in achieving better work-life balance, more time for your family and friends, a healthier lifestyle, and more.   In this group you can expect to find career advice and resources for job seekers who are interested in work flexibility and remote work. Useful for sharing ideas and inspirations around flexible work, job search, career advice, and work-life balance.   Get feedback on your resume and portfolio, discuss frequently asked interview questions and make connections that’ll help you kickstart your next career.   Advertising freelance -  Advertising Freelance is a group for consultants who work in the field of communications and advertising. Digital, Production, Creative, Account, Strategy, Media - really anything that has to do with the world of freelance is here. Join on a project to project basis or help one another individually find new opportunities. The group is founded by Kevin Amter the author of “Minds For Rent” written specifically for creatives learning how to freelance. There’s some great content in his book. Freelance professionals -  Freelance professionals is a much larger group for freelancing and small business. Its members range from I. T, 3D Modellers, Animators, Art Directors and Copywriters to Editors, Proofreaders, Interior Designers, Marketers, Photographers and Programmers. There’s a plethora of content to digest here, and the content is divided by channels so you’re bound to find what you’re looking for. The same rules that apply to prior groups apply to this one - Don’t self promote, instead offer great content that will foster solid relationships and help establish you as a figure head within your industry. Freelance writing moms -  This group is a bit niche, but it’s no secret that freelancing offers you the luxury of setting your own schedule to work in any location. Stay at home moms tend to lean towards being independent freelancers and small business owners since it allows them the time they require.   This is a group for moms who are also freelance writers. Use it to network, share leads, call for experts, or just ask for a little commiseration now and again. If you’re a freelance writing mommy, join up and become a part of this thriving community. Self Employed Leadership Group: The Group For Small Business Owners, Entrepreneurs and Professionals -  If you are self employed, or are on the road to being your own boss, yet you sometimes feel isolated or just like to keep up with business trends and info, this group is for you. Gain support, understanding and business growth insights with other like minded business owners. Posting your business articles, thoughts and ideas is encouraged, as is commenting on other posts. The road to six figures is a tough and lonely road, encourage yourself by supplementing your environment with people that have similar goals! Writing on linkedin -  A group for discussing, learning, and sharing best practices for creating content on LinkedIn. Social media algorithms change all the time. What worked on Facebook in 2017 doesn’t work as well now, stay up to date on how to most effectively amass an audience on this platform by discussing tactics with others in this group! Independent contractor compliance and engagement -  Created in 2010, Independent Contractor Compliance &amp; Engagement is the “premiere group to share information, opportunities, resources, and services that will help grow engagement of independent contractors, freelancers, solopreneurs, and consultants (1099s) in the US corporate workforce. ” That mouthful of information basically entails this group to serve any and every need you may come across on your path to six figures. Much like the other groups, you’d do well to make sure you post regularly and engage within.   All these groups can be leveraged together and honestly should be, as you never know where you’ll find the resource, aid or connection needed to advance yourself ahead of competition.   What did you think of the list? Will you now take massive action and start to network?  I’d like to hear from you, let me know your thoughts!   If you’re looking for more tips on marketing and networking for your business be sure to grab my Ebook here.

    "title": "Top Vital Tools and Sites for Digital Nomads in 2020",
    "body": "2020/02/19 - Hey everybody! So being a digital nomad can be a tough job where you’re required to wear many hats and do tons of things. The prospect of being able to #workanywhere and be a perpetual traveler, getting to know new people, new cultures, new awesome places… all while working in more countries than there are top ten videos on YouTube. Without the right tools you can end up shooting yourself in the foot and missing out on possible time and money you could save. To make life on the road easier, I’ve compiled a list of organizational tools necessary for the everyday solopreneur in 2020. You can also download my pdf on “50 online business tools for entrepreneurs” and check out my resources page for even more important tools I can’t live without. Take out a pen and paper cause we’re about to compare some things. Knowing your SMART goals will help in prioritizing what tools would be most helpful. Ready? Let’s dive in! (I’ll include a table of contents when uploaded to wp) (I’d like to also include a small snapshot of each site in order to add something visual) 99 Designs - For help with creation and design: 99 Designs is a site where you can hire designers to create anything from illustrations to logos and brand identity. This is beyond helpful when you’re in need of a quick illustration and you don’t have the time to make it yourself! Fiverr is also a good alternative, although the quality can vary and therefore I prefer 99 designs. QuickBooks - For all your tax purposes: You hear that? It’s the sound of the IRS knocking on your door because you didn’t pay your taxes! Kidding, of course, because you’re a responsible travelling entrepreneur that would never make that mistake. Tax season 2020 is already here and if you’re self employed, you’d really be in need of some kind of tax software to stay on top of things.   I personally use QuickBooks self-employed and could not live without it.   You can track income &amp; expenses, send invoice &amp; accept payments and track your miles. Plans start as low as $15/Month. There’s other options out there like Freshbooks but I’ve only used QuickBooks. If you’d like more information to make up your mind my buddies over at dailylogochallenge wrote a great article comparing quickbooks with freshbooks and xero. Dropbox - Cloud storage for your stuff: Dropbox is a cloud storage service where you can store and access your files anytime anywhere without fear of losing it. It is also convenient for sharing files with other people, saving you time to download or upload files. All you need to do is send a link to other people and they will be able to view the file anywhere in the world.   This is huge when you’re working with freelancers or with a team of your own. Dropbox also offers 2 GB of storage space with their free plan so if you just need it to hold your project files, this is a grand option. HoneyBook - Cloud CRM tool: Manage projects, book clients, send invoices and get paid — all on HoneyBook. Why over complicate the process? You’ve got enough to do as is, HoneyBook helps creative entrepreneurs and freelancers book more clients, manage projects and get paid all in one place. One of the main ways HoneyBook differentiates itself from competitors is by enabling its users to accept online payments without integrating with a third party service. It’s recent partnership with Citi Ventures will allow for even more diverse services! HoneyBook pricing starts at $40. 00 per month, there’s a free trial too if you’d like to give it a shot before committing. StrongVPN - Browsing security: When you’re constantly on the move, you don’t have the luxury of using your own private Wi-Fi. It’s no secret connecting to public connections at coffee shops and fast food restaurants could leave you vulnerable to bad people with way too much time on their hands. There’s just no way around it, you need to use a VPN, I recommend StrongVPN. Having been in business for more than 20 years, StrongVPN are also one of the few VPN providers with an absolute zero log keeping policy (that means they don’t record your data) so you can watch cat videos without worrying about getting your search history sold. They also don’t block or throttle traffic, including torrents. They offer two plans, one where you pay $10 every month or $5. 83/month billed annually.   Freedom - Productivity app: Working online has its perks, but you ever just had a day where you couldn’t get anything done?  Whether you were stuck scrolling through your instagram feed, watching youtube videos or texting – your focus where it needed to be. I’ve been down the unproductive rabbit hole, I think it’s hard not to in this day and age. Thankfully I found Freedom. to and it’s helped me block out all distractions keeping me away from growing my business.   You can sync your blocks across all your devices, whitelist sites, and even schedule blocks of productivity where you can do nothing but work. Life changer for anyone struggling to balance their work and personal life. You can get started with Freedom for free today. Toggl - Time management tool: Having a hard time improving your time management? Toggl helps you keep track of your time so nothing is wasted. It also provides pretty visual reports of your team progress and billable time which you can share with your clients and team. This popular cloud-based time tracking app is one of the simplest to use time tracking tools on the market. It’s great for several reasons, but you may be interested to know you can use it both online and offline. It is mostly web-based, but does have apps for desktop, iOS, and Android that will sync together in real time. In terms of project management, Toggl allows you to break down exactly how much time a project took, as well as the tasks that made it up. This helps so much in estimating how long a project will take and pricing accordingly. Toggl also integrates with iCal feed, Asana, Basecamp, Freshbooks, GitHub, and Teamweek; That way, you can keep track of your time and benefit from features Toggl doesn’t offer. There’s no reason to not use a time tracking app, Toggl is free to use for 30 days so give it a try. Noisli - Background noise for concentration: Noisli was made with the intention of helping you concentrate and focus on work. There are plenty of studies online suggesting that ambient sounds are beneficial to concentration and focus. Noisli offers a variety of background sounds in order to make your study, work or research session impactful. You can create your own combinations of sounds, add favorites and curate playlists for just the right occasion. Noisli offers sounds for sleeping, commuting or just hanging out!

    "title": "Interview With #JustAddGratitude: How Getting Bitten By A Dog In The Jungles of Malaysia Changed My Life",
    "body": "2019/10/29 - Want a Better Life? Just Add Gratitude!: I had the honor of sitting down with fellow Remote Year participant, Shannon Kurkendahl, a couple months ago to discuss the importance of gratitude on the Just Add Gratitude Podcast. In this interview I recall one of the most challenging experiences of my life, and why I’m so grateful for it now. At the time, my thoughts were “Why Me!?,” but now I see it as a blessing that has helped me to appreciate my life even more. Every day above ground is a good day, as Pitbull would say. The magic is in seeing that, even when the shit hits the fan. Listen to the podcast on your choice of providers, or read the full transcript below. XO  Orignal on UpAutomation Apple Podcasts Google Music Spotify Sticher Intro:                   Welcome to the #justaddgratitude podcast. Here you’ll discover inspiring stories of personal and professional growth, level three fun, marketing tips, business development and travel adventures from entrepreneurs, digital nomads and creatives alike. Now sit back, grab a drink and take a 30 minute gratitude break with your host Shannon Kurkendahl. Shannon:           Hi everyone. Shannon here. Thank you for joining me for episode four of #justaddgratitude. On today’s episode we have Kate Bagoy from Katebagoy. com. Kate has been obsessed with travel since a flight she took to Oregon at the age of six. In 2017, Kate left the U. S. To travel full time as a digital nomad. Kate runs her coaching business entirely online and she loves helping other entrepreneurs grow profitable work anywhere businesses. Hello Kate. Thank you for joining #justaddgratitude. Welcome to the show. Kate Bagoy:        Thanks so much for having me, Shannon. Shannon:           So tell our audience a little bit about you. Kate is also part of the Remote Year community. She’s been traveling around the world. She’s a digital nomad. But yeah, tell our guests a little more about yourself and what you do. Kate Bagoy:        Sure. Hi everybody. I am Kate Bagoy, as Shannon said. I am a designer turned business coach and I run an online program called Six Figure Freelancers, helping people to start their work anywhere businesses. I’ve been working in kind of the tech world for a really long time and when I went on Remote Year kind of pivoted more into a coaching role and teaching other people how to build their businesses as small businesses, think like startups. Shannon:           Very cool. One of my favorite questions to ask, whenever I would meet somebody new that was part of the Remote Year program was what was going on in your life at the time that you found Remote Year or Remote Year found you. Did you see it in an ad? How did you come across Remote Year? And this is not a Remote Year promotional podcast. I just happened, it’s just happens to be a very large part of my life so there will be lots of stories. Kate Bagoy:        Cool. Yeah, that’s a fun question for me. I had become aware of a Remote Year long before I actually applied. When they first launched, I was working at a startup and so I was always just watching the startup newsfeed and there was a bunch of stuff about Remote Year, this new company that was doing this weird thing. I had been watching that. I was like, Oh, that sounds really cool. But I was in the middle of an early-stage startup and we were getting ready to launch. So it was not good timing to apply. So I never did. And then a few years later, maybe, I think Remote Year had been around a year and a half when I joined. I had left that company, started my own business, moved across the country by myself to Savannah, Georgia. And I was absolutely loving life. But Remote Year just randomly popped up in my feed on Facebook again and it was like, hmm. And I hemmed and hawed and was like, well I know if I apply, I’m going to get accepted and if I get accepted, I have to go. Shannon:           Of course they’re going to want me. Kate Bagoy:        So yeah, so I waited a while and really sat on should I apply or should I not apply because I knew if I got accepted I would go. And so there was no question of whether I would balk if they offered it to me. But I eventually did apply and got accepted right away and there we go. Shannon:           And so it was just a matter of transitioning away from the current job to start traveling. Kate Bagoy:        It was, and I had already been on a little bit of a nomadic journey about a year, maybe two years before I had taken a solo trip to Bali, Cambodia, and Singapore. And I had had this incredible spiritual experience at Ankgor Wat and kind of committed at that point that I wanted to travel more and I wanted to inspire other people to travel and live their own dreams. And simultaneously I happened to be reading the four-hour workweek on the plane ride. And so from that point, I kind made a decision to travel more. And I had started doing that. I was traveling every month domestically and a couple of times a year internationally. And I had taken a few nomadic trips on my own while building my business. And so it was, it was kind of a no brainer when the Remote Year thing came back around to be like, okay, this is the next level. This is how I take it there. Shannon:           Oh, very cool. Now you were doing design work at the time, so you didn’t have the coaching business. Kate Bagoy:        Correct. Shannon:           And so in your about section on your website, you talked about trying to start your own business about three times you were, you helped about 60 other businesses start businesses. What you were getting stuck on, what it was you needed to do for your own and you hired a coach. What was that experience like for you? Kate Bagoy:        Oh, it was so many years of up and down and up and down and burnout. I think some people are really great employees and some people are terrible employees and I’m a terrible employee. Shannon:           I’m a terrible employee. Kate Bagoy:        Yeah. Not in the way that I don’t get things done. I’m exceptional at getting the work done, but I’m not good at being in a company and being managed and I’m not good at being in the office from nine to five just because somebody says that’s when you’re supposed to be in the office. It’s like some of my best work happens at midnight. And I was just miserable in that no matter how many new companies I went to, and no matter how great they were, and no matter how fun the project was, I after a few months was back into this burnout stage. Kate Bagoy:        I work really hard. I put in a lot of hours. I always go the extra mile and I would burn myself out. And I would get frustrated with the corporate politics and the drama and the meetings. And it was finally just after the last startup, which was actually my favorite company I’ve ever worked for. We had an amazing time for a couple of years launching this business and they’re doing really well, which I love. But I was still in this burnout mode, even with people that I love, that I’ve become family. I was just miserable working for somebody else and I realized I just had to make a choice. If I was going to finally get my own business off the ground, I had to figure out what it would take to do that and I need to hire help instead of trying to keep doing the same thing over and over again. So I hired a coach. Shannon:           Well, and the nice thing about coaches is they can put things in your view that you didn’t even realize were available to you. Kate Bagoy:        100%. Shannon:           I’ve done that myself. You hit a plateau. I think a lot of businesses do that. You’ll hit a plateau and you just want to get past it and you’re not sure what you need to do. And honestly, the best thing you could do for yourself, do some research. Find a coach, find someone that can put eyes on your business, every aspect of it. And say, “Oh, what about this?” And you might even have ideas already that you want to implement and again, a coach will help you sort of that’s a great idea, do that. So it’s just a second set of eyes on what it is that you’re doing so that you can grow and improve. So I commend you on that. I totally just agree with if you want to succeed that’s what you have to do. Shannon:           So another one of the things that are fun to talk about on Remote Year and eventually I’m going to get Travis on the podcast, brought his name up a couple of times so far and he has agreed to do a show. So I’m really excited when I can actually get him booked because I love how he explains level one, level two and level three fun. So the most popular though with Remote Year is the level three fun. So do you have a level three fun story and would you like to share it with the audience? Kate Bagoy:        I have quite a few. I even have like a level four-story, but I’m not going to share yet. Shannon:           Oh wow. Uh oh. Kate Bagoy:        Level four is where it’s … Shannon:           Is there jail involved? Kate Bagoy:        No, it’s just I’m grateful to be alive. Shannon:           Okay, there’s that one. Kate Bagoy:        But it’s funny in hindsight. Yeah. I mean I think my favorite level of three fun stories for me was in my first month. I’m introvert first stuff, so we should preface this story. I went from living by myself alone in my two-bedroom apartment in Savannah, Georgia and spending Tuesday mornings on the beach all quiet to flying to Kuala Lumpur and living with 80 people. Shannon:           Oh god, yes. Kate Bagoy:        And hugely overwhelmed, in Asia. We’ve got events every single night of the week and everybody wants to do coffee and everybody wants to go out and all of this. And I’m also sober and so I have to manage my energy as well. So anyway, got to Kuala Lumpur, there are all of these events going on and I tried to do them all, which is a really bad idea as an entrepreneur. And the third side trip of the month, a bunch of us had gone to Penang, Malaysia from Kuala Lumpur. It was initially supposed to be three of us in this Airbnb I’ve rented. And then all of a sudden 12 people showed up that were [crosstalk 00:09:05] supposed to be on the floor. And I’m like, I can’t even. So I left the Airbnb that I had rented and got a hotel room by myself. Shannon:           Oh no. Kate Bagoy:        Yeah. Because it was just too much for me. After, this was actually after I had gone out for a morning walk and had a complete breakdown. I bought breakfast at a gas station and cried on the beach for an hour. I was like I can’t do this. I decided to make a shift. So I went and got myself a hotel room and then I went on an adventure. It was like, I’m going to just go have some solo fun, some quiet fun without all these people. And instead what happened is they took the cable car that they have that goes up this mountain and Penang and there’s this nature garden sort of thing up at the top. Kate Bagoy:        And I’m walking around this mountain and apparently I somehow got off the path, ended up lost in the jungle in Penang. Could not figure out a way out. And was it walking around for at least an hour and then kind of came up on a farm and it was like, oh great. At least there are some people around except that instead what happened is five dogs come running out of the field and surrounded me in the circle. I mean it was like something out of a movie, right? How does this even happen? Kate Bagoy:        So I’m lost in the jungle in Penang, I’ve been walking around for like an hour and a half. I don’t have any water. I have like 10% left on my cell phone and I don’t even know who I could call and I can’t get GPS. And now I’m surrounded by five dogs barking at me and going freaking crazy. I ended up having to throw my camera at two of them that tried to attack me, but the third one got in and bit my ankle. So now I’ve been bitten by a dog. Shannon:           Oh gosh. And now you got to think the rabies, right? Oh my Gosh. Kate Bagoy:        Yeah. And I’m still lost and I’m running now because the dogs are chasing me. So I finally, I get away from the dogs, but now I’m even more lost and it’s getting dark and there are monkeys dropping coconut out of the tree. I’m just walking up this hill. Shannon:           Monkeys are scary. Kate Bagoy:        Oh my god, they’re evil. Shannon:           People think monkeys are cute and sweet. No, they’re freaking scary. Kate Bagoy:        They’re little jerks. Shannon:           Yes. Kate Bagoy:        They are adorable little jerks. Shannon:           Jerks. Kate Bagoy:        And so I’m a huffing up and down this mountain, completely lost just telling myself like, just don’t die. Just don’t die today. You’ve been through worse, you’ve been through boot camp, you’ve gotten sober. Telling myself every story I can to get out of this freaking situation. And I did obviously eventually find my way back to where I needed to be. But it was about three hours lost in the jungle, bleeding from the ankle, from this bite by a dog. And then I had to had to go to the ER to make sure that I was fine. Shannon:           Yeah, that you don’t have rabies. Yeah. Because who knows what their practices are there when it comes to that. Wow. So was there any well of panic that you felt rising up? Kate Bagoy:        Oh God. Shannon:           What were some of the, yeah, probably a lot. What were some of the emotions that you were going through and how did your belief system sort of come into play with that? What was the growth that you, I mean, I could spout out what I assume some of the growth was, but ultimately it’s got to come from you. Where did you see the growth opportunity once this is all said and done in your home safe because you’re definitely not thinking about this while this is happening. Kate Bagoy:        No, I mean at the time I was just scared and thinking I’m going to spend the night in the jungle. I’m probably going to get eaten by some sort of animal or die of exposure or thirst or whatever. All the fear that goes through and interspersed with moments of like, you’re strong enough, you can manage this, you’ll figure this out. Everything’s working out for you. All that sort of stuff. It was definitely a really interesting adventure. Shannon:           Lots of inner dialogue going on for sure. Kate Bagoy:        Oh, tons. And I have a pretty chatty inner dialogue even when I meditate. It’s pretty chatty. And when I’m scared in the jungle and bleeding and tired, it’s not a pretty place to be, my brain. So back to your question, I got a lot out of it actually. So it turns out, let me give you the full story. So I had the treatment or what I thought was the treatment for the rabies. I had a really great experience actually. This Uber driver picks me up and took me to the hospital and he actually waited in the ER with me for the whole hour and a half that I was there because he’s like, “I just want to make sure you’re okay and I want to take your home. ” And it was like heartwarming. Right. Shannon:           See, okay so Uber is not scary. There are fantastic Uber drivers all over the world. Kate Bagoy:        I mean it was amazing. He’s amazing. Shannon:           That’s really nice. There are good people. Kate Bagoy:        Yeah. And that was one of the gifts that came out of that was that reminder of people are good and people are here to take care of you, even in different countries where you don’t know the language and all of that sort of stuff. That was beautiful. And I had a great experience with the doctor except that two months later on my six rabies treatment, I was in Vietnam at this point and I went to get my last rabies treatment and the doctor was going through all the paperwork and then she just got this weird look on her face. And she said, “Huh,” which is not something you want to hear from the doctor. Shannon:           No. Kate Bagoy:        Ever. Shannon:           No. Kate Bagoy:        Ever. And I was like, “What’s up?” And she goes, “Well, I don’t think they gave you the proper treatment in Penang. ” And she said, “I_t looks like they gave you the regular shot, but they didn’t give you the actual antibodies_. ” And I said, “So, basically you’re telling me that if that dog was infected, I’m likely going to die any day a horrible and painful death. ” And she said, “I don’t know what to say. ” Also, another thing, you don’t want to hear from a doctor. Really horrible, horrible day. So what came out of all of that though is this immense sense of gratitude for my life. And a reminder that every day is a gift and we just don’t know. We don’t know when our last day is on earth, whether you got bit by a dog or not or you’re in perfect health, an accident could happen, a terrorist attack could happen. Any sorts of things could happen and this could be your last day. So, are you living it right? Shannon:           Are you doing everything you want to be doing? Kate Bagoy:        Exactly. Shannon:           I just, I said this a few days ago. If you’re waking up in the morning and you’re dreading the day, you got to look within, look within and find out what’s going on. What are you doing? Are you doing a job that you hate? Which I think a lot of people are. So we have choices. Kate Bagoy:        Exactly. Shannon:           Firm believer in that. So and I get it, not everybody’s up for starting their own business. But I think that whether it’s giving back, which is finding something that helps build you back up, that fills your cup so that you in turn can fill other people’s cups. Kate Bagoy:        Exactly. Shannon:           And having that in place. Kate Bagoy:        I think for me it’s less about the circumstances, the job, the no job, the business, the no business or whatever as taking care of yourself, loving yourself, respecting yourself and making decisions that actually support the life that you want to create. Because that’s what we do. We create our own lives with every decision we make. And sometimes that decision is to stay stuck and to stay bitter and angry and keep accepting the same things in our lives. And sometimes that decision is to make a different choice and that’s where the change comes in. Kate Bagoy:        And it’s normal to have up and downs in life and there are going to be periods of time where things are really great and things aren’t really great. And sometimes it’s both. Sometimes one area of your life is going brilliantly and the other is not, and that’s all normal. But if you wake up too many days in a row and say, I hate my life, what do I have to do today? You might want to consider making a change. Shannon:           Yeah. Kate Bagoy:        Because that’s a choice. Shannon:           100%. So thank you. Thank you for sharing that. What is something that you would like to share with our listeners? Any tips, where they can find you? Kate Bagoy:        Sure. I mean so many tips, right? I mean I think it’s like I said before, remember that life is a gift. You only have so many days on this planet and you get to create your life. It’s not your conditions. This is a Tony Robbins quote. “It’s not your conditions that control your destiny. It’s your decisions. ” So if you’re stuck and you’re stagnant and you’re unhappy in some area of your life, make a decision to change that area of your life. You don’t have to know every step of how to do it yet. Just make the decision that you are going to change that part of your life. You are going to do what it takes. You are going to commit to finding the help that you need to help, you going to start the business, end the relationship, start the relationship, whatever it is. Make that decision. Because that’s how everything changes. Shannon:           Oh yeah. Well, then I something else that too is it doesn’t have to be all done at once. Kate Bagoy:        Nope. Shannon:           I think sometimes people can stop moving forward because they’re overwhelmed with the amount of work that’s involved to get to the next chapter of their life or the next level or what if it is that they’re trying to get to. Whatever goal they’re trying to reach. You don’t have to do it all at once. Kate Bagoy:        100%. Shannon:           I started the process of doing a podcast and it literally was, I’m going to do a little bit each day and now I’m at this point in time, there are four episodes and I’ve got two more that I’m getting ready to do and eventually I’ll have a hundred episodes. So it’s just little by little. So and be easy on yourself, when you say something, say kind words to yourself. Kate Bagoy:        Yes, absolutely. A lot of my clients, probably about 90% of the people that I work with, end up working with me because of that. Because they get so overwhelmed with all of the things they have to do that they become paralyzed. It’s this paralysis by analysis. There’s a perfectionism piece in there as well. And the analogy that I love to use, and I can’t remember where - I got it from somebody else, one of my coaches that I worked with, but I can’t remember who right now. But the analogy is you can drive from San Francisco to New York entirely at night, only seeing the next few hundred feet that your headlights illuminate. You don’t have to be able to see every mile of the journey ahead of you in order to get to your destination. You just need to take the next stupid step. Shannon:           Oh, I love that. Wow. That just, yes, I absolutely love that. That is so true. I don’t think I’ve ever heard that before, but that’s, yeah. Wow. Thank you. Thank you for that. Kate Bagoy:        You’re welcome. Shannon:           So we’ll go ahead and start to wrap this up now. So tell everybody where they can find you. I know you’ve got some really great information on your website, so I’ll let you share your resources. Kate Bagoy:        Sure. I’ve got plenty of options for reaching out that really the best place to go is my website, which is just Katebagoy. com. K-A-T-E B-A-G-O-Y. Because you can find everything there. I’m also @kbagoy, just the letter K and then my last name Bagoy on Facebook and Instagram. I’ve got some free training on my website. I’ve got plenty of free downloads if you’d like those. And you can also feel free to just shoot me a message from my contact page. Shannon:           Absolutely. And so you help freelance. So you’re, what is it specifically that you’re doing? You help freelancers get out there and travel or are you just a little more detail about what it is that you do? Kate Bagoy:        Actually what I do is I help creative corporate burnouts build businesses that they can run it anywhere. So typically I work with people that like myself were, have one of those corporate dream jobs or whatever and are very good at what they do, but they’re miserable and terrible employees and they want to run their own business and they’re just overwhelmed at how to start. And I give them a step by step strategy for building a six figure, location-independent business as a solopreneur or a small agency. Shannon:           Oh, that’s fantastic. So Katebagoy. com guys, go find her. Kate Bagoy:        Thanks so much. Shannon:           Kate, thank you so much for being on the show. I really, really appreciate it and I look forward to running into you at one of the citizen houses with Remote Year and hanging out. Kate Bagoy:        Likewise.

    "title": "How Do I Find My Soulmate? Become Relationship Ready",
    "body": "2019/10/17 - A couple years ago I wrote a post and promised to be authentic AF in my marketing, and to write a blog post a week. I failed on both counts. Not that I’ve been inauthentic, per se, but that in my quest to grow my business coaching programs I stopped sharing much related to my personal life. And I forget that sometimes what we need to grow is inspiration, not more information. So, while I only offer life coaching in conjunction with my business programs, I’ll be sharing more of my personal growth journey here in the hope of inspiring you to change your life. Right now, love is on my mind, so let’s start there. :) The last few years I’ve been consumed by career, travel and personal growth. So I’ve decided 2020 will be the year I focus on LOVE. Specifically, juicy, passionate, romantic love. Romantic partnership is the one area of my life that’s been significantly lacking. You see, I have a pattern of dating unavailable men. Ever since my first boyfriend. How do I know this? I’ve taken inventory. The first time was in my 20s, when I realized I kept having the same relationship over and over again - and kept getting hurt. I took a hard look at the patterns and decided to take time off dating. I was single for years and learned to actually enjoy my own company before I started dating again. When I did, things got better and I met a great guy. We started building a life together. We were great friends and had so much fun together!! But we were terrible as a couple. When it ended, I was both devastated and relieved, so I took inventory again. I felt betrayed and I didn’t want to see my part in it. I didn’t want to see why it never should have started. I really wanted to validate my self-righteous anger… But I did the work anyway, and saw how I’d yet again chosen an unavailable &amp; unsuitable man. How I’d forced a relationship and ruined a friendship. How I’d stayed when I was unhappy because I didn’t believe I deserved more, and was afraid to hurt him. How I’d stayed with him and continued to hurt him until he hurt me more. Ouch. When I got sober a couple years later, I did inventory work again with a sponsor. I got to see just how fucked my mindset still was when it came to men - even after doing this work for years. This isn’t to say that past partners didn’t do things that hurt me - but that I had to see MY part. Because that’s all we have control over. I had to see MY character traits and weaknesses so I could change my behavior. No trust. No boundaries. No self esteem. More work. More self love. More improvement with every date. A few years ago I found myself in a whirlwind affair. With a recent divorcé. Who told me he didn’t want anything serious. Couldn’t handle it. Didn’t want to hurt me. Ladies, when I man tells you something, listen. Don’t do what I did, which is say: “No prob, let’s just have fun. ” Lies. Lying to him. Lying to myself. I caught feelings, not flights… And was, naturally, devastated when it ended. So I started doing more work. Unearthing more patterns. And saw clearly my habit of falling in love with men incapable of loving me back. Sick men. Wounded men. Great men at the wrong damn time. Men who were just not that into me. Of course I already knew this… But this time I actually **felt** it. And I saw for the first time how I’d managed to find a way to repel great men - men who would have made suitable partners. “OH, you’re great and stable and like me? Hold my beer while I blow this ish up. ” Once I saw the pattern, I knew what to watch for. How to (mostly) avoid self-sabotage. And my dating life, though sporadic, has improved even more the last couple years. While I’ve not had a serious relationship in a while, I’ve had some really great dates and met some seriously amazing men. Of course I’ve had some bad dates too, like the psychopath I met in Vietnam… But it hasn’t phased me. It’s just part of the process. And the joys of online dating. ? Which is why I’m loving my friend Heidi B’s new book, Relationship Ready: How I Stopped Fucking Randos and Started Cupcaking My Soulmate. Funny. Poignant. Cringe-worthy in parts. Eye opening. Even though this is at least the 4th time I’ve done work around men and relationships, I’m seeing new things. Like that I avoid conflict like the plague. So, in the past, if I didn’t blow up a good relationship spectacularly, I’d just cut them out of my life. Ghosting. Not something I’m proud of. Not something I’m hoping to do again. So, the work continues. But I feel good about my ability to change my behavior. And more importantly, I’m more confident than ever in my ability to create a loving, healthy, romantic relationship - with a worthy gent. I feel relationship ready. If you’re tired of settling for crumbs of affection… If you’re sick of having the same relationship over and over… If you’re DONE being anything but happy with your relationship status, this is for you. Grab the book. Do the work. Become relationship ready. Get Your Copy on Amazon {Header Photo by Christiana Rivers on Unsplash} "

    "title": "41 Books That Might Change Your Life (& 3 Rules to Live By)",
    "body": "2019/09/22 - Want to change your life? Read a book!: Today is my birthday, so I can’t help but think back on my life. If life is a movie, mine has been an epic tale full of adventures, plot twists, and a LOT of character development. I come from a loving but dysfunctional family and have survived alcoholism, abuse, bullying, heart-break, crippling depression and a host of other shit. I spent years drinking myself to sleep, trying desperately to please people and hating myself. Now, I wake up (most days) genuinely excited and grateful to be alive, I’m running my second 6-figure business, have friends around the world, and get to travel as a digital nomad. Next week I head to Mexico City and then on to South America, visiting more places I drooled over back when I was a 7-year old kid obsessed with National Geographic magazine. Usually, when someone asks me how I’ve done any of those things, I think “read a damn book, bro. ” Now, I’m not going to pretend that I am perfect, or even that I have my shit together most of the time. I mean, last week I dried my face on clothes because I forgot I’d left all the towels in the washer the night before. But, even when I’m a hot mess, I’m usually a pretty happy hot mess. Which was NOT always the case. I thought I’d write and epic post about all the things I’ve learned, but when I sat down to write, I kept coming back to the same 3 things: 1. Mind Your Own Business &amp; Don’t Take Anything Personally. : Basically, you do you. You can’t control what anyone else says or does. And what they think of you is none of your business. Besides, most people are too busy thinking about themselves to be thinking about you. And if they ARE in your business, it’s probably ‘cause they can’t stand to think about their own lives - it ain’t about you. So let that shit go. 2. If You Want to Change Your Life, Make a Decision &amp; Take Action: Stop overthinking, overcomplicating, overanalyzing, focusing on what could go wrong or trying to get everything right. You’ll never get it perfect, so you may as well get it done. Let go of how you’ll do it / get it / be it - and simply decide you WILL. Take action everyday until you figure it out and get what you want. And you will. 3. Learn From Those Who’ve Gone Before You: Maybe it’s changing careers, losing weight, finding a better job, quitting a bad habit, starting a business, running a marathon, overcoming a devastating loss or a breakup, moving to another country… Whatever you want to do, chances are someone else has done it before. Ask them how they did it and take the shortcut to success. If you don’t have someone in your life who can help, Google that shit, hire a coach or read a book! There’s a book on nearly anything you could imagine (and some you probably can’t). If you allow it, some might even change your life. Below is list of 41 that have changed mine (and a handful more here). XOXO PS The list is In loose alphabetical order, because classifying by category = hard, and me = lazy.

I had to chase you down a little bit but I’m glad that I was able to lock you in place and again I’m so excited that you’re so thank you very much. Kate [00:03:13] Thanks Brian - I’m good. I’m excited to be here and I’m glad you did chase me down. Brian [00:03:17] We’re going, we’re going to talk about some cool stuff today. So you know we’re really going to discuss some marketing strategies but we’re going to do it from a short term perspective. Right? Because I think one of the biggest struggles that early entrepreneurs face is landing their first client. Right? So you’re really going to give us some practical strategies that they can follow so that you can get your first client. Yippee. And you can build some really short term marketing strategies that work really well for your business. So, super excited for this conversation. Let’s dive in. I want to ask you a question and let’s back it up just a little bit. So first things first… If you are starting a business what are some of the things that you really need to know about business in order to be successful? Kate [00:04:09] What a fabulous question, Brian. There are so many things but you know there are really there are two really really important things to do before you think about starting a business. Kate [00:04:21] Number one is understand that your mindset is hands down the number one factor in your success. I’ve been working with startups and small businesses for over a decade. I’ve been involved in over 50 or 60 startups and I can tell you that every one of them that failed did so because the founder gave up. It’s 100 percent a mindset problem like yeah. There’s always an excuse. I ran out of money. We ran out of funding. You know my dog died, I couldn’t go to work, whatever. But it’s really it’s about mindset. If you don’t master your mindset you will give up because building a business is hard. If it wasn’t everybody would do it because it’s fantastic - right? So that’s number one is adopt that business owner mindset. Kate [00:05:02] But number two is really you have to understand what business is - particularly important for small business owners and creative people - that’s the the my clients are tend to be creative people and creative people. We didn’t study business in college. Nobody told us what a prospect was or what operations was. So you need to understand the pieces of business and more importantly need to understand marketing. Kate [00:05:26] So I have a visual here that I want to share, just really quickly that I created for some of my clients. Are you able to see my screen here. ? Brian [00:05:37] We got it. Kate [00:05:39] Cool. So this is business in a nutshell. I like to just break it down to the basics because people over complicate business and thinks it’s it’s just this really complicated process to start a business. And the reality is, from a small business standpoint, there are four big areas of business: there’s marketing, which is where you find leads and connect with people. there is sales, which is turning those people into customers, operations, which is doing the work, getting the stuff done and then everything else. And I keep that everything else there because for small businesses that’s usually stuff like accounting and you know stuff that you don’t necessarily need to spend a ton of time on and you can outsource. Right? Kate [00:06:18] So really understand business itself is simple. We over complicate complicated as entrepreneurs and the more creative you are the more you will overcomplicate this. So try and keep it simple. And then from a marketing and sales it’s really important to understand the timeline of how you connect with people in business and you know I like to define words for people - particularly the creative people  -because I think it’s very unclear what a prospect is versus a lead in all of that stuff. Kate [00:06:48] A prospect is basically anybody that is potentially a client for you. And that’s really the whole world, technically, but for our purposes today we’re going to say anyone that interacts with you or your brand that could potentially down the road be a client. Kate [00:07:04] A lead is someone that actually says “Yeah, I’m interested”. In some format or other - they gave you their email, they gave you their business card, they said hello… Whatever. They’re actually interested. Then, a client, of course, is somebody that actually said “I want to hire you”. Right? Kate [00:07:20] And then partner is what you do with those clients long term. When you do a really great job and they want to work with you again they start promoting you and they start actually sending prospects and leads your way. Right. Really cool thing. And this is what it looks like in real life. Kate [00:07:34] You meet somebody, you get the digits, you get hired, you get more leads. Brian [00:07:40] Love it, Simple. Kate [00:07:41] Marketing in a nutshell. Kate [00:07:44] I’m going to stop here. Brian [00:07:45] No, that’s fantastic, and I love how you simplify it simplify it because I do think that a lot of people tend to make it much more complicated than it needs to be. And I think it actually goes back to your first point about mindset, right? You know our mindset tends to make this much harder than it needs to be and so let’s cut through that and let’s make it really simple for people. Kate [00:08:09] Keep it simple. Kate [00:08:10] That is the best advice you can get when you’re first starting out. Brian [00:08:15] Awesome. So if you let’s say I’m an aspiring entrepreneur and I want to build a really high end brand, is there a specific formula that you follow in order to do that? What sort of methodology that you take? Kate [00:08:30] Yeah. So there I mean there are millions of ways to build a business and I like to always be clear about that. Make sure that any time you’re building a business you’re authentic to you, particularly as the founder, you want to build a business your own way. There is no you must do X, Y and Z. Kate [00:08:46] That said… I have found in my experiences for service based business owners and small businesses that want to build a high end brand, there are like five areas that you really want to focus on from the long term standpoint of building that brand. Kate [00:09:02] And the first thing, again, is you want to create a you want to master your mindset and within that you want to create a vision for the business that you’re creating. I know a lot of entrepreneurs that go into business kind of accidentally or haphazardly and then a couple of years later they realize “I hate everything that I’ve done - I hate the life I’ve created for myself. ” You know you end up being a business operator instead of a business owner. So the first thing I want to do is really set a vision and understand what you want to build so that you can be authentic to yourself. Right? Brian [00:09:35] You don’t want to leave the rat race to join another rat race essentially. Kate [00:09:39] Exactly right. So you master your writing but think like a business owner and then visualize that success. Decide what you actually want to build before you build it set some clear goals and that acts as a North Star. So as you start building your business you guide you to make the right decision. Right. Kate [00:09:56] The third thing that I think is really important is to understand that you need to position yourself as an expert if you are a service or your company isn’t specialized. You want to be a specialist not a generalist right. You want to be a painkiller not a vitamin. And that’s what allows you to work with the higher end brands at higher end prices. Generalists don’t make the big bucks, typically. Kate [00:10:20] Unless you’re specialized in a very niche market ,which is the fourth thing - is you know your market. And you want to know your audience better than they know themselves, and more importantly, you want to really understand their pain points and the outcomes that they’re after. Because people aren’t buying your service - they’re not buying your products - they’re buying the results that come from them. Brian [00:10:45] Yeah. Kate [00:10:45] Right. You know I’m not buying graphic design service. I am I am buying a better brand. I am buying better communication, I’m buying more clients, ultimately. And in business - if your business-to-business, usually the outcome is more leads. More sales. More money. If you’re a business-to-consumer it’s usually feel bette,r be more confident. That sort of thing. But you need to understand what it is you’re really selling not the service that you’re offering. Brian [00:11:15] I want to just reiterate that for a second here so you know I think what you’re really keying in on here is determine your niche, right, determine what you’re going to specialize in. And you said it, but I’m going to reword this just in my own words. Specificity brings opportunity. So, the more specific you are, the more people you’re actually going to attract. And that’s key. So get really really clear on your niche. Right. From there. What was your next step? Kate [00:11:44] And from there it’s about learning how to sell the outcomes, not the service or the solution, the product. You’re selling what they really want. So it’s narrowing down your niche to the smallest market possible, knowing them really well, and then selling what they actually want. You can give them what they need, but you’ve got to sell them what they want. Brian [00:12:08] Yep. So. So just as an example here if I want to lose weight. Right? That’s my goal and I might need to shift my mindset or release some emotional blocks that I have that are keeping me holding onto the weight. But that’s not what I’m buying. I’m buying the losing the weight. Right. So yeah I love that. That’s great. Kate [00:12:32] I’m buying being able to get into a swimsuit this summer. I don’t want to buy a diet program. I don’t want to buy a coach that’s going to tell me not to eat sugar anymore and make me uncomfortable. I don’t want any of those things! I just want to look good in a swimsuit! So focus on the outcomes and the way that I define that in my Six Figure Freelancers formula, I’ll just recap that really quickly because I got a little excited there and I got a little off track. . Brian [00:12:56] hahaha. Kate [00:12:56] It’s about mastering your mindset is number one right. Think like a business owner. Kate [00:13:00] Number two is visualizing your success and creating the vision and the goals for your long term vision so you don’t create a business you hate. Kate [00:13:09] Number three is positioning yourself or your company as experts and specialists. Be a master not a dabbler. All right. Kate [00:13:17] Number four is narrowing down your niche market, so the the smaller the market the better because you can talk to them in their words that you know exactly what they need. And it actually broadens your reach, believe it or not. Kate [00:13:29] And the fifth one is promoting your brand or your services not your skills, right. You’re you’re you’re promoting those outcomes. Brian [00:13:38] Yeah. You know I want to ask you a question because I see this all the time I see new business owners coming in and getting really terrified to niche down because they don’t want to leave anyone out. And I get it - as someone as as empathetic as I am, I want to serve everybody. But it’s just not possible. So what do you say to those folks? Why is it so critical to get really specific hyper specific, if you will? Kate [00:14:06] Yeah. If you’re trying to talk to everybody you’re speaking to nobody. Brian [00:14:09] Right. Kate [00:14:10] The reality is that by niching down, niching down does not mean you can’t work with anybody that comes to you, that wants your your services, your outcomes… But what you want to do from a marketing perspective is be hyper-clear and focused on the outcomes, on the things that your ideal client wants &amp; needs. Kate [00:14:29] And when you can narrow your client down into something so specific that you can actually picture a single person as your ideal client - all of your marketing communications become seamless. It becomes easier. Conversations become easier and when you’re niched down and it’s very clear what you do and who you do it for and the outcomes they get - sales conversations become just that! They’re conversations. You’re not selling. You’re not having to be sleazy, you just talk about “What’s your problem? Can I help you? Would you like to work with me?” “Yes please. ” Ka-Ching. Brian [00:15:01] Yep Kate [00:15:03] That’s sales. IF you have targeted your products and services in a manner that works for that client. Brian [00:15:12] Yeah I love it. And it confused mind says no. So if you are all over the place right, and you do a little bit of this,and a little bit of that, you’re you’re not you’re gonna have a really hard time selling. Right. So. So I think like a real key that I want to bring to the audience here is make sure that you niche down because like Kate says, it really is going to help you to speak to that customer in really clear and compelling ways. And it does ultimately makes the sales process effortless and that feels nice. Kate [00:15:47] It’s just cool. Yeah it’s crazy. You can tell the difference you know if you go to a website that’s really broad and that uses really general terms you know “we make websites” yay. Versus you go to a site and it’s like “Killer websites for startups,” and you’re a startup. Boom - I’m already in. Like, just that headline alone, tells me this person understands my problem and gets me. Brian [00:16:13] Yeah I love it. OK. So. Was there a step five? Did I miss that? [00:16:18] Step five was just promoting your your outcomes and not your skills. So promoting your brand not you know your service. Like, don’t sell “graphic design,” sell “better communication” right. Don’t sell “diets”. Sell “Looking good in a swimsuit. ” Brian [00:16:36] All right. So you know so we’re gonna get into this process now where we’ve identified our niche we’ve gotten really specific. We’ve got some really compelling messaging in place. Now we need to go out and we need to start attracting people to us. And, you know, as you know, the Internet’s getting bigger and bigger and bigger and everyday it’s just like the universe it’s just ever expanding. Right? And so there are so many options and opportunities that are out there in terms of marketing and I want to get your opinion on sort of the best marketing platforms that are out there for online businesses or even for some brick and mortar businesses that have online presence. Kate [00:17:17] OK. Yeah. So a couple of things there. First, I’d backup really quickly to online presence. And I would just say that really I want you to remember that the goal of any online marketing activity is simply to turn cold leads into warm leads. Kate [00:17:32] And I didn’t talk about cold versus warm but basically you know, a cold lead is as somebody that you’ve never really interacted with. You know they were strangers until recently, and a warm lead is somebody that you’ve built some sort of relationship you, or they’re a friend of a friend or a referral and they feel like they know you. Kate [00:17:48] And the reason that we do all of this online marketing and we do e-mail programs and Facebook lives and websites and all this stuff is simply to start building a relationship before we actually have a conversation. And it turns those cold leads into warm leads. Kate [00:18:02] So with that in mind you want to think about where you need to be online in order to connect with your ideal client. So, if you’ve done what we talked about before - you figured out who it is you want to work for and what you can offer them. That’s number one and right - you know your customers. So the next question is, “where are they hanging out already?” Super super simple. Kate [00:18:24] You know, if you know your client, you know where they are online. So make a list of where they are online or in person! You know, maybe it’s events - like, when I started doing freelance design years ago one of my strategies was just to go and volunteer at startup accelerators, right? That’s where my clients were. Kate [00:18:42] Just make a list of where they’re hanging out online in person, all of that. That’s the first part… And then the second part of that is you need to know yourself and particularly this is for the solopreneurs that are just starting out - You need to know what platform YOU actually enjoy and will stick to. Do NOT pick something that you hate to do because you won’t do it. And then you’re not doing any marketing. Brian [00:19:07] True Story. Kate [00:19:08] You know. And also with that, don’t try and be everywhere when you’re first starting out. Pick one to two networks - preferably one to become an expert in like for me, that’s really from a social standpoint, that’s Instagram. I’m a creative person. I love taking photos. I travel full time. I use Instagram. But, that said, if you are in a business to business role - do not underestimate the power of LinkedIn. LinkedIn is hands down THE best platform for connecting with B2B clients. I personally have used it as a designer to lend a ninety thousand other job and a sixty thousand dollar design contract, without doing anything. These people came to me, because I had picked the right keywords. I had a compelling headline, I had a clear call to action. And the rest is history. Brian [00:20:01] Voila. Kate [00:20:01] Voila. So,  if you’re B2B, be on LinkedIn. If you’re anywhere - you know if you’re B2C, probably Facebook or Instagram depending on your style. Maybe Twitter. Maybe Quora. There are so many options… but figure out where your customers are and where you want to be and find that overlapping venn diagram. You should be right in the middle of that venn diagram. Brian [00:20:25] Yeah, I love that. And don’t underestimate some of the other ones that are out there. Pinterest is an example a lot of people say that you can’t get good business from Pinterest but that’s so far from the truth right. And I would think especially if you’re a creative creative person in your selling to creative people that Pinterest would be a fantastic place for them. Brian [00:20:45] My other favorite one for younger folks right. Millennials or younger would be Reddit, but I mean believe it or not there are discussion forums out there all over the place and just all the young folks seem to gravitate. I’m now officially old but only young folks seem to gravitate over there. But I I love this. I love your recommendation and I want to again underscore this. Choose one - maybe choose two - but if you really want to become an expert. Start with one, build it out, get really comfortable with it, make sure it’s one you absolutely love to use and then move on from there. Kate [00:21:25] 100 present. And particularly when you start out, because that is one of the most common mistakes that clients come to me with that have been in business for a while they’re not getting any traction and they don’t know why and they’re like I’m working a hundred hours a week I’m posting on every social media platform. But they’re not doing it right…. They’re not understanding the platform, they’re not understanding that every platform has different purposes, different audience behavior, different psychology about what to post. Like, speaking of Pinterest versus Instagram - Pinterest works really really great if you’re into content marketing and you can do a list of all of five things to grow your business and you do a nice big infographics and it links to your site or you’re a designer and you do a Web site that sort of thing. That doesn’t work as well on Instagram. It can work. If you do a nice animated video I’ve got a designer friend that’s 60 thousand followers on Instagram. He does really well, but it’s not as common, right? Kate [00:22:17] Instagram is more like - I want to check out. I want to look at really cool places. I want to be inspired, I want to see cool clothes. Facebook like I want the dirty gossip - who’s spilling the tea - and usually a way to just check out. Brian [00:22:30] And one of things that I do love about Facebook is the power of groups within it, right. Brian [00:22:37] So that’s a really it’s a way to not only build an audience but to also have them highly engaged, right, which I think is a little bit more difficult on more and more open platforms like Pinterest as an example. Kate [00:22:52] Yeah. One hundred percent. And again - going back to that “Know Thyself” - groups can be phenomenally powerful, but they take a lot of effort. And if you’re somebody like me who is an introvert, and doesn’t like to spend a lot of time on social media, it’s a bad idea. I tried it! I tried building a group but I’m like “This is hard. Nobody is interacting…”. Brian [00:23:13] hahaha. Kate [00:23:13] And there’s nothing like running a Facebook group with just crickets, right? Brian [00:23:16] Yeah. Kate [00:23:17] Know yourself, know what time you really want to put in. Know what that’s going to get you. If you love being on Facebook and you like doing Facebook lives or posting regular and interacting with people - groups can be phenomenally powerful. Brian [00:23:29] Yes. Kate [00:23:29] But they take a lot of a fair amount of effort to get going at the beginning. Brian [00:23:33] So any other recommendations that you have just about selecting and leveraging online marketing platforms. Kate [00:23:43] Those are really the biggest ones. I mean, I would say if I look at it from a standpoint of somebody that’s brand new to business and maybe only used social media for personal - don’t stress so much about social media, particularly when you’re first starting out, because that is a really a long term strategy. Kate [00:24:01] As I said, online marketing strategies it’s really about building your brand, right. You’re, you’re turning those cold leads into warm leads. Social media is typically not the best way to go to market in terms of landing your first clients. Brian [00:24:15] Yep. Kate [00:24:15] Which is a great segway. Brian [00:24:17] Yeah. So let’s talk a little bit about landing your first client because I think that what a way to you know really prove to yourself that you can do this right when you land that first you know four figure  client, there’s there’s this feeling that happens that is just absolutely exceptional so. So what’s the process that you use? Kate [00:24:40] Yes. So I, again, this is where we tend to really, really overcomplicate starting a business. Everybody that thinks about starting a business for the first time usually thinks in order to go to market and start / launch my business…. “I need this amazing website that I gotta spend twenty thousand dollars on and I’ve got to have a professional logo and I’m gonna have an email marketing program and a funnel and …” . Kate [00:25:07] You know… all of these things in place. I need to have an MBA and the right certifications and the testimonials. We overcomplicate the crap out of it. Kate [00:25:15] What you actually need to start your business is a product or service offering that somebody needs, a way to connect with those people and an offer to get them to work with you. Period. Brian [00:25:29] Yep. That’s it. Kate [00:25:30] And there are people - I have met people that run six figure businesses with just that. They never even bothered to get their Web site. You know it depends on what you want in the long run, but you can really get simple with this. Kate [00:25:42] And so what you actually need to get a client is, again, going back to knowing your clien - you want to create some sort of package or service offering. This is for the higher end package. We’re assuming that we’re talking about getting a five or ten thousand dollar job, you know, if you’re a coach you need to have some sort of package or offering and you need to know what they’re getting for that money right. Kate [00:26:05] You need to understand those pain points and list them out. And then I highly recommend some sort of online presence. If you’re B2B that can be as simple as a LinkedIn profile - like you don’t need a twenty thousand dollar Web site. And in fact if you’re spending 20 thousand dollare on a website before you have a client I will tell you you’ll probably fail in your business your first year. Brian [00:26:27] yep. [00:26:27] Don’t waste your money before you validate your service or solution. Right? If you want to do a real  website, start by doing a single landing page. Just keep it really simple. And then you’ve got to have a way to talk to people. You Know I used Calendly for the first year of my business. Calendly is a great little tool for instantly booking a call, a consultation. And I had multiple clients when I was doing design work say “the main reason that we’re having this call is just because you made it so easy to get in touch with you. All these other designers had these contact forms and I had to fill things out and tell them what I want. And yours was just like pick a day and we’ll talk. ”. [00:27:09] So make it easy for people to talk to you. Make sure that you’re in places where you can talk to people, and have an offer to give them. That’s another thing that people fail to do. You know it blows my mind sometimes - I’ll talk to people and they’ll be like “well, you know I meet all these people and I think they’d be great candidates, but they never seem to want to work with me. Like, “Well, did you ever make them an offer?”. Brian [00:27:29] Mmm Kate [00:27:32] We forget - you have to actually say “do you want to work with me?”. Brian [00:27:36] Yep Kate [00:27:39] Ewwww. You know the introverts in us go “oh my god, promotions. ” Sleazy…. I want to be a car dealer. But the reality is what we talked about earlier - if you’ve done a good enough job of understanding your potential client, the outcomes that you’re offering, it just becomes a conversation. Kate [00:27:56] You know it’s “Hey how you doing? I heard you have this problem. ” “Yeah. This is what I’m struggling with…” Brian [00:28:03] So I make a comment about this because I look at the sales conversation as an extension of delivering service to your client. So, if you are a coach, if you’re a consultant and that’s your day to day - what you do  -the sales conversation is really just an extension of that. You are still serving, you’re still providing value. And like you said, it makes it much more of a conversation. Brian [00:28:28] Now, when I started love your Monday mornings I want to just go back to what you said about using Calendly. I used Acuity. I did not have a web site. In fact, my website still not up. We’ll be eventually, but… But, you know, I started off by connecting with all my friends and family, letting them know what it is that I was doing. I set up Acuity, which is another scheduling system similar to Calendly, and just provided the link to everybody and said “hey, if you know somebody, put him in touch with me, here’s a link to schedule an appointment. Brian [00:29:00] And, you know, I want to say that just within a month long period I ended up having 30 conversations with potential clients. And I learned so much through that process about what they did, what their pain points were, how I could serve them. And you know, honestly Love Your Monday Mornings and my programs within Love Your Monday Mornings were born as a result of that as a result of that. Just listening to those people and really designing something that they actually needed. So so I love that. I love that you don’t have to go out and spend 20, 30, 40 thousand dollars on a fancy website with all these bells and whistles. You know Calendly or I’m going to say Acuity cost me, 20 dollars a month? Kate [00:29:49] Mmmh, yeah. Brian [00:29:49] That’s all it took me to start my business. Kate [00:29:51] Yeah. And Calendly’s Free. Brian [00:29:54] Good to know. Kate [00:29:54] So, yeah. Well they have a paid program too…but Yeah. I mean, when you’re starting out - keep it simple. There was a book a few years ago for anybody that’s been in tech called The Lean Startup that changed the game and it’s about iteration. Right. You want to prove - you want to validate your idea before you go all in on it. And so you got to get out there and talk to that. And so yeah. You know when you’re first starting out it’s great. You have that vision and you can imagine that twenty thousand dollar web site and how amazing that’s going to be to have everything automated. Kate [00:30:26] But at the beginning, you want to take a step back and you want to focus on your fastest path to cash. And your fastest path cash is always going to be warm leads. So it’s just like you said, it’s sharing on the existing networks that you have. It’s reaching out to your friends your family everybody you know to tell them that you launched a business. That’s one that people love to do to - like “well, I don’t know why my friends and family aren’t supporting me?”… Kate [00:30:47] Did tell them that you started a business? Did you share your website? Did you ask them to share your website? Did you make it easy to share your website? That’s another thing -  make it easy for your friends and family. Give them a templated e-mail or a templated social media post that they can share your stuff on. Make it easy for them, because people are busy and we got our own lives. Everybody’s busy and focused on self. That’s just the reality of the earth. Maybe Mother Teresa once in a while we get those that are truly other focused. But everybody is typically focused on their own stuff on the day to day. So make it easy for them to help you and connect you with the people that you want. Brian [00:31:26] Yeah. You know when I you know again going back to when I started Love Your Monday Morning and I went out and reached out to my friends and families. I literally sent them emails that they could share with other people. You know I said “Hey I’d love for you to refer people to me. Here’s an email that you can send them with a link for them to schedule the appointment. ” Just like that. I mean it’s super easy for them to just cut and paste and forwarded along and and voila. Like we said you know 30 30 conversations later… You know my business was off the ground. I had a bunch of clients that I was working with and was able to grow from there solid. Kate [00:32:01] 100 percent. Yeah, absolutely. And really I just want to you know kind of a conclude with a really easy exercise for how to get going with this idea. Once you’ve got your ideal client and you know what you want to offer them - sit down, take out a pad of paper, and write down a hundred people or more that you know. Brian [00:32:21] Yeah. Kate [00:32:21] Just anybody that you can reach out to you and ask for a referral, Or invite to work with you - literally everyone you can think of that you have a good relationship with. Right. Start There. Kate [00:32:32] And then go through your list and pick out five people who you think are the best candidates to actually work with you and get in touch with them! And you don’t go straight for the sales - you don’t just be like “hey buy my produc,t” whatever. Start a conversation. Say “Hi. Thinking of you.   I wanted to let you know I’m now in business. Do you have any interest in having a conversation?” Or just “Hey, thinking of you” and allow the conversaion to unfold. Brian [00:32:56] Yes. And literally the exact same process that I followed and I think I ended up putting about 200 people on my list but I love what you said about going and going through that list and cherry picking, right. You pick the people that are easiest, that you have the warmest relationship with, and you cold check them first because chances are they’re going to want to support you and they’re going to go out and refer. And then you move on to the harder ones. Like, I had found that the hardest people for me to ask for referrals were the people at the job that I had just left. That was the hardest for me. So those folks went to the bottom of the list and eventually I got to them and even some of them I scratched off the list. I was like “No, I can’t do it”. But you know make it easy on yourself and I think that that’s a fantastic way to do it. Kate [00:33:42] It’s just you know and you’re gonna see on that list, with some people you’re gonna be like “oh my god that would be the perfect guy”. Like, maybe that’s actually where I came up with my ideal client… I was thinking about you know Christina or Brian or whatever, and other people you’ll be like “No, but they love me…” You know, like, my mom - not my ideal client at all - but, my God, does she share everything I’ve ever done. She’s terribly proud of me and comments on every single social media post I’ve ever made in my life. You know she’s my number one fan. Brian [00:34:11] Yep Kate [00:34:13] And that’s what making that list is -  you’re going to see how many people are really there to support you, that you can reach out, and just ask for a referral, ask them if they’re interested, ask “Who do they know” that would be interested? Kate [00:34:27] That’s a great way to phrase it, rather than thing “do you know anybody?” Say “Who do you know”. Because it triggers that question, where they actually start thinking about people and you know visualizing that internal Rolodex. Brian [00:34:39] And I also find that asking permission essentially so asking them “would you be willing to share this with people that you may know?” right. That that I think gives them an out - they can say, “you know what, I don’t really know anybody” and that could be that. But it’s a little softer approach than just saying “hey, send this to all of your friends!” All right. Kate [00:35:00] 100 percent. Brian [00:35:00] How do you know I want to mention something that happened when I was doing this just to give people a heads up that this is the reality of what will happen. Brian [00:35:09] Some people will completely ignore you. Brian [00:35:12] And I want you to know in that process that that has nothing to do with you. And it has nothing to do with your business. That is their own stuff. And for some reason they they are just stuck in that and that’s OK. So you know just know that as you’re contacting those hundred people and people just fall off the face of the earth that that again that has nothing to do with you and come from an open heart and forgive those people because really it’s just it’s just their own stuff that they’re working through. Kate [00:35:44] Yeah or they’re just busy, or they miss the e-mail. I mean the reality is that it is nobody else’s job on the planet to support you, except you. It is your job to support you. It is your job to believe in your business. It is your job to know your vision. It is your job to understand your client. It is your job to promote your business. Nobody else is obligated to do so. That said there are probably a lot more people ready to support you than you really imagine. Brian [00:36:12] Yeah. True story. Awesome. Great stuff. Brian [00:36:16] So you know any final thoughts for folks in terms of landing their first client and really getting themselves out there so that they can start to build their business? Kate [00:36:28] Stop making excuses. Stop over complicating things, and just take action. Kate [00:36:33] If you take action immediately, you’re far more likely to actually get moving. So if you have an idea, sit down, write down those people that you want to work with, send an e-mail today. Or schedule it, put on your calendar - but take immediate action and just step over complicating things! Keep it simple. Kate [00:36:50] It’s what we do. I do it still. Brian [00:36:56] Yeah, and I’ll add… don’t beat yourself up in the process and pay attention to the thoughts that are happening because all of those thoughts. “What am I doing? Why am I doing this? I’m not good enough. I’m never going to write. ” Those are the things that are ultimately going to hinder you. So you really have to become really good at putting those thoughts aside, pressing forward ike you said, taking action day after day and recognizing that you’ll get better. It it’ll get easier. Right. And then it eventually will just start to fall into place. And I it’s like we we said in the beginning of this conversation - so many people quit their business for so many excuses. But the reality is that they just didn’t continue to take small steps forward and they left their head in the way. Kate [00:37:45] Yep. Consistency wins over huge actions every single time. If you take small steps every single day you are more likely to stay in business longer than that person that does like “let’s do 16 hours in a row trying to get everything done” and then doesn’t do anything for months. Be consistent. Small things add up a lot faster than you imagine and a hundred percent - Watch your mindset. You are worthy. You are loved. You are worthy of everything you want in your life.

    "title": "How Do you Become a Successful Freelancer?",
    "body": "2019/07/17 - Freelancing is a $1. 4 TRILLION industry.   That’s 12 zeros. A million million. A heap of money, really. And some of that pie could easily be yours, aspiring freelancer. And it’s not contingent on your being the best at what you do. It’s having the ability to CONSISTENTLY bring new clients in the door that will allow you to scale your income &amp; live the lifestyle you want. Everyone knows a freelancer who’s always struggling to make ends meet. The one that can never seem to pay bills and always seems to have a client from hell? Or maybe this has been you in the past - you started freelancing and spent dozens of hours writing proposals on freelancer. com or Upwork, then got a bunch of clients that wanted lower rates and worked you to the bone?  Stories like this are incredibly common, and probably one of the biggest reasons people are afraid to leave their jobs to start freelancing.   But if you’re seeking location independence or financial freedom, you’re not likely to get either working a day job.   So how do you become a successful freelancer and, ultimately an online entrepreneur, without the constant struggle? There is ONE super important thing you MUST do before you start your business if you want to be a profitable freelancer.   Are you ready for it? You MUST stop thinking like an employee who’s embarking on an extended job search &amp; start thinking like a business owner. Simple, right?  Yet, 8 times out of 10, when I meet someone who’s struggling with freelancing they still have an employee mindset keeping them stuck.   They’re not running a business - they’re just searching for jobs. Here’s what broke freelancers do to struggle:  They sell their skills as commodities rather than providing services They use their resume to try to capture the sale  They spend more time “looking for projects” than promoting  They have no marketing strategy, a poor web presence and no processes They think sales is a dirty word and suck at talking about what they do  They do everything for their business fast, cheap and, frankly, half-assedDon’t be  ^^that freelancer.   Here’s what business owners do differently:  Sell services to their clients, not their resume Know who their client is and what they need (a TARGET MARKET and a NICHE, respectively) Fall in love with their clients and create solutions that serve them Know how to talk to clients in their language and how to “talk business” Compete on expertise and results rather than cost, quantity or speed Adopt a testing mindset and aim for constant improvement, not perfection or praise Spend their time building a brand and selling versus searching for “gigs” And 8 out of 10 small business owners value regular coaching, according to recent Robbins Research StudyThis same study showed that 77% of small business owners believe they will be able to grow their business through the next recession, even though they are less sure about how they will do so. The great new is you don’t have to know exactly what to do to grow your business - you just need to know the next step. Adopt a business owner mindset instead and start investing time, money and energy into building a business instead of searching for jobs. Want a piece of the $1. 4 Trillion freelance market?

Today we’re digging deep into short term marketing strategies to help you land your first big client. Hello creatives. I’m Adrian Lauren the host of the thriving artist masterclass and during this expert interview series we will be discussing how to position package and pitch your creative work to resonate with more buyers. Today we have Kate Bagoy. Listed as one of Thrive Global’s limit breaking female founders, Kate Bagoy is an award winning designer, strategist, business coach and founder of SixFigureFreelancers. com - the go to online program for growing a high value freelance business. Adrienne: [00:00:45] After quitting a corporate dream job in 2008, Kate moved to the Silicon Valley to manage design and marketing for a mobile startup. The Valley wasn’t a fit but she caught the startup bug and has been working with entrepreneurs ever since. Kate has worked with more than 50 startups as a designer, marketer, product manager, strategist, analyst and advisor. She is a graduate of the Portland seed fund, served as a mentor at multiple accelerators and educational programs including Washington State University’s map program and Georgia Tech’s ATDC boot camp and has led projects for several Fortune 500 companies including Nike, Ricoh, HP, Apple, BP and Microsoft. Kate holds a BFA in graphic design and an MBA in marketing and international business. Obsessed with travel since the first flight to Oregon at six years old, Kate left the U. S. in January 2017 to travel full time and runs her business entirely online. She helps other creatives do exactly the same thing at sixfigurefreelancers. com. Adrienne: [00:02:02] Kate’s product personal mission is to inspire and empower people to lead lives by design not default. And on that beautiful note, please welcome Kate Bagoy. Kate: [00:02:14] Hi. Thank you so much for having me. I’m excited to be here. Adrienne: [00:02:18] Yes I’m so excited to have you too. So you’ve been traveling a lot. Where are you tuning in from now? Kate: [00:02:24] Currently I am in Long Beach California. I’ve just come off of two years of full time international travel and I’m back in the states kind of looking for where I want to be longer term. Adrienne: [00:02:36] What a fun and exciting thing to try to figure out. And I think even for me too I’m just thinking it’s like wow I’d be so glad to be running your business and traveling a lot. And today we’re going to really dig deep into how more freelancers can build and sell high ticket offerings which would give them the freedom to travel whenever, wherever. And so I’m really excited that we’re digging into this. So OK sixfigurefreelancers. com - that is your baby, that is your creation. After working with a lot of freelancers what do you think is the main difference between a 6-figure freelancer and a typical freelancer? Kate: [00:03:24] Well there are a couple of pretty key differences but I think the most important one is that six-figure freelancers understand that they are building a business. They make this mindset shift to think of it as building a business rather than searching for jobs. So one of the top mistakes that new freelancers make when they get started as they try to skip all of the marketing piece of building a business and they go straight to finding work. And they end up in this kind of endless cycle of hunting for gigs. You know, on Upwork or the other freelancer platforms or Craigslist … whatever and they’re constantly searching for jobs. And then while they’re working on those jobs they don’t have anything bringing in leads. Which is part of running a business. Kate: [00:04:08] So that’s one of the really key pieces is making that mindset shift to think like a business owner. And that’s one of the things that I find a lot of time with my clients… It’s like you’re you’re not searching for jobs or not searching for gigs you want to actually build a brand and build a business, which means you need to think like a business. Adrienne: [00:04:28] Gotcha. Kate: [00:04:30] And once that’s done then there are a number of steps that six figure freelancers do a little bit different than the typical freelancer and number one is really learning how to market themselves effectively. It is absolutely critical. I believe anybody can be a successful business owner with the right mindset and the right marketing strategy. Adrienne: [00:04:51] And we’re going to dig deep into that. So that’s exciting. Kate: [00:04:55] Exactly. Adrienne: [00:04:56] Do we want to just give a quick like recap for the group, because some people tuning in are completely just artists - don’t really know anything about marketing. Some of them have been freelancers for a few years and they’re figuring out how to up their game. Some of them may already be comfortable at selling high ticket product offerings and we want to figure out how to make that a more consistent thing. So maybe could we just give like, Cole’s notes of what marketing is here? Kate: [00:05:32] Yeah. I like to simplify it a lot particularly as creative people right. Most of us studied art or design or something creative in college we didn’t really learn about business and, you know, any creative program that you studied to learn the actual skills that you need to be a freelancer or artist, typically didn’t set you up to run a business. It set you up to find a job doing that. Kate: [00:05:57] And so it’s really important… business Is really simple. So if you want to be a business owner really there are four key areas that I like to break down a business. Kate: [00:06:06] There’s marketing which is really bringing in people into your business. Sales is having that conversation and making them an offer to work with you or to buy something from you, if you’re a traditional artist. Operations is like how your business is operated what you actually do how your structure your day. There’s everything else and creative people you don’t really need to worry too much about everything else that’s like finances and legal and structure. It’s just not as important when you’re getting started. So we’ll skip that. Kate: [00:06:34] So, as I said marketing is really the piece that most creative people and freelancers in particular struggle with because they’re not equipped for it. They put up a portfolio with the work that they did which is great for finding a job - it’s not great for finding freelance clients. So, understanding the marketing funnel is really there’s four pieces of a marketing funnel. You’ve got prospects, leads, clients, and partners. And so the way that I want to break that down to make it super simple is a prospect of anyone that interacts with you or your brand - it’s people you meet at trade shows, people that come to your website and see it - just anyone you meet that could be a potential customer. Right? Kate: [00:07:17] And then leads are anyone that says “hey, yeah I am interested. ” Or they fill out a contact form on your website, they give you their business card, they say “that sounds cool - tell me more. ” That’s a lead, right? They’re interested. And that’s marketing - prospects and leads. And then you move into the sales cycle and a client is anyone that says “yes, I would like to work with you. Here is my money. ” So you get hired, they become a client. And then partners are anyone that ends up supporting you or promoting your brand. So that’s referrals, people that have done business with you before and tell all their friends, your friends and family who are your biggest members. And so that’s marketing and sales in an nutshell. You meet someone, you get their information, you make them an offer, they hire you and then you repeat the cycle - hopefully with people that are bringing more leads your way. Adrienne: [00:08:04] Awesome. Awesome. That was such a good concise summary. I think everybody is on the same page now. Cool. OK. So let’s really dig deep into the main question of this talk which is, what does a freelancer really need in order to land that $5K plus client? You’ve got a bunch of points to talk about this and we really can’t go into everything in 40 minutes, like that’s really ambitious. Just so you guys know, don’t like freak out - I know this is going to be a lot of information thrown at you. There’ll be an opportunity to learn more about it later in the end but OK. So be patient with yourself, just let this soak in - if it’s too much that’s OK. Re-listen to this or check out the freebie at the end. No pressure. But I’m really I want to make this really like jam packed with a lot of value so I’m really excited to dig in. So, what does a freelancer really need in order to land that $5K plus client? Kate: [00:09:07] Well I don’t think I’m going to surprise you with my simple answer to this. So I want to get a little bit more into building the long term six figure brand and that’s where we’ll get a little more in depth. But for the first time when you’re starting out - when you’re a freelancer - when you’re just getting started, you want to focus on your fastest path to cash for finding your first big client. What we tend to do as business owners, and as creative people, is think that we need an amazing web site. We need a brand. We need a funnel. We need a logo and an e-mail program I need a blog with a bunch of posts. We need an MBA and certification. And testimonials, right? This is what we think we need. Kate: [00:09:48] What do you actually need to get a client, is a product or a service that hits a pain point for a specific type of person or client. We call this an ideal customer in your target market. Which is where they are. But you want something that actually solves problems or offers a solution for them. Kate: [00:10:09] You need some sort of online presence, particularly if you want to work anywhere the way that I do. This can be as simple as a linked profile. A Web site is really nice. But keep it simple at the start do not invest $10,000 in a website before you have clients. And you need to talk to people and offer to work with them. That’s what you really need to land your first big client. Kate: [00:10:33] But, let’s step into the marketing piece because this is where it’s most critical. After you’ve made that mindset shift that we talked earlier, about thinking like a business owner, what is really important to getting those big clients - the $5K and $10K + $20K clients - is that you position yourself as an expert. Kate: [00:10:56] And what I mean by that is you want to be a master, and not a dabbler. You want to be a specialist and not a generalist. That’s like the difference between going to a general practitioner when you have a heart problem or going to a cardiothoracic specialist. You want to be the cardiothoracic specialist for your clients issue. So if you’re a designer per se, you don’t want to sell yourself as a designer. You know you’re not selling “graphic design. ” You are selling better client communications, you’re selling more leads on a website or you’re selling improved visuals of your brand and, you know, more excitement. You have to learn what it is that your clients need, in order to sell them solutions in their language. Make sense so far? Adrienne: [00:11:53] Yeah. Kate: [00:11:53] Perfect. So yeah… we want to position yourself as an expert, and then you want to focus on a very niche market. The smaller the market - particular when you’re getting started out and if you want to work with high end clients - the smaller the market the better. We think we’re limiting ourselves by narrowing down our market, right. This is a common thing. Well, “I want to work with small businesses but I’m afraid that that means no one else is gonna work with me. ”. Kate: [00:12:18] Clients that want to work with you are going to come to you regardless. But what happens from a marketing perspective when you narrow your niche is you start talking in their language and you become the person they want to work with. And I give you another example. So, let’s say you’re an event manager and you have a website, and up on your website you’ve got three types of services. One - you do birthday parties and bar mitzvahs. Two, you do corporate meetings, and three you do small dinners. And it sounds great in theory, you offer these three very just disparate services to three different type of clients. Kate: [00:12:53] But what happens is, somebody will come to that website, and if I am a corporate client - let’s say I’m American Express and I need somebody to run a $1M event for me, and I see that you do birthday parties. I’m going to go “this gal is too small. She cannot handle a million dollar event if she’s doing birthday parties on the weekend. ” Right? Kate: [00:13:14] And likewise, the mom who is looking for a really great birthday party for her kid comes in and sees that you’re doing a $1M event for American Express and she says “there is no way I can afford this person - I’m out of here. ” So now you’ve lost two people because you’re not speaking my language. So that’s the importance of narrowing down your niche. Knowing who you want to work with - and you want to get as clear as possible with that before you start marketing - and then conversations become easy. And again, as I mentioned before, that fifth piece is you want to learn how to promote your services and the benefits of working with you, rather than your skills. Adrienne: [00:13:59] So we’re gonna dig deeper into this by trying to give them a quick recap because we kind of like show flew over that. So the first one was really mastering your mindset learning how to shift from thinking like each person that you’re meeting is gonna give you a job or a gig. And actually… Kate: [00:14:19] It’s more about shifting from searching for jobs. Adrienne: [00:14:23] Oh. Okay Kate: [00:14:23] You’re actually building a business, right? So what happens a lot of times… sometimes people come into freelancing because either their last job has ended or because, like me, they’re burnt out and they quit without a plan. I did that multiple times. And then, you kind of get into this cycle of searching for short term work. Searching for gigs, searching for things on Upwork or small jobs… And you’re constantly really just hunting for jobs -you’re not building a business. Kate: [00:14:52] So what a business owner does when they build a business, is they sit down and they create a plan and a vision for the business. This usually involves a business and a marketing plan. It can be as simple as saying “I want to work for my living room in my pajamas three days a week, and I want to make six figures a year and I’m going to do that by using my graphic design services to help small businesses grow. ” Like, it can be that simple but, understanding that you are creating an actual business and then learning what you need in order to make that business a reality. Is that a web site, is that an online funnel or is it just going out to local events where your business owners are &amp; having conversations? You figure that out as you grow, but that second piece after you master your mindset is really creating that plan and that vision for your success that you can create. Adrienne: [00:15:42] Mmm hmm. Kate: [00:15:44] The third thing is learning how to position yourself to be that specialist, versus a generalist. It’s determining who that ideal client is, and how you can serve them. And that’s focusing down on a niche market, right? Which Is number four. Kate: [00:15:58] The smaller the better, in terms of the client that you serve and the services that you offer. So for me, my six figure freelancers business was “killer design for startups. ” Everything I did was design work for startups in order to get them to grow. It was like creating websites and marketing and online products specifically for startups. And so it was very targeted to them - somebody else it might be small businesses, it might be a large business, it might be female coaches who like to travel, right? The smaller you can go with your market, the more detailed your, more powerful, your marketing and your conversation and your copywriting becomes. Kate: [00:16:41] And then the last piece, once you’ve narrowed that down your niche and the services that you offer and you kind of establish yourself as an expert, is again, selling the benefits or your services, and not your skills. That’s creating packages based on what your clients need, or determining what those pain points are or the value that they want when they work with you. And that gets in a little bit to the psychology of sales. Why do people really buy from you? Why do people really hire you? You know, for me as a coach, people don’t really buy “coaching” from me. What they’re really buying is confidence, and support, and strategy for growing their business and feeling like they can do this, right? It’s feelings and all of that… As a designer what people bought from me was better communications, more leads, more sales. Adrienne: [00:17:33] Yes. Kate: [00:17:34] It wasn’t design. Adrienne: [00:17:36] Yeah. Yeah, the distinciton is really… The power is in making those distinctions. Yeah. Kate: [00:17:43] Exactly. And so it’s a process to get there, but that’s really the six figure freelancers formula- is like, you know, make that mindset shift and understand that you were running a business, not searching for jobs. And that means you’re gonna have to stretch yourself and learn some things that you might not like to do as a creative. [00:17:59] You know, it’s not in your nature to plan out promotions, and things. You want to create things, you have ideas. When you’re a business owner, you have to actually execute and make sure that you consistently do things to bring in business. And then that comes to creating a plan and sticking to it. That’s visualizing your success and, you know, learning to market yourself as an expert to a niche market, and selling the benefits and services instead of skills. Adrienne: [00:18:28] Yeah. Kate: [00:18:29] That’s the six figure freelancers formula. Adrienne: [00:18:31] Amazing. OK. So a big theme of this show is how to position, package and pitch your creative work to resonate with more buyers. And so I’m thinking I’d like to dig deeper into the third one where it’s like positioning yourself as an expert, because there’s some people like I mentioned earlier that are tuning in and they’re kind of just starting off. So some questions that are arising in my head on behalf of them is kind of like “well, I’m just starting off - I don’t feel like I am an expert. So, how do I now go and position myself as that? If I don’t see that in myself right now? Kate: [00:19:12] Gotcha. Yeah. So, if you’re not an expert that’s OK. You can at least become a master in a certain area, instead of a dabbler. What I mean by that is instead of trying 100 different types of things - go deep. Go an inch wide and a mile deep on a problem for a specific client, instead of going a mile wide and an inch deep with one hundred thousand different people. Right? There’s a great marketing term that when you speak to everybody, you talk to nobody. Nobody hears you when you’re trying to be all things to all people. So look at all of the things that you are talented and capable or want to do with your business. And pick one two three items to focus on in terms of trying to sell services or solutions. Kate: [00:20:01] So if you’re a writer, instead of trying to sell Social Media, writing blog posts, writing copy, writing for websites, technical manuals… every sort of writing… Pick one that you actually really like. And that’s where you start. You say “I write copy for websites. ” Period. Right? And go out and try and sell that, and spend a month doing nothing but selling copywriting for websites. Instead of trying to sell anything to anybody that needs writing. Adrienne: [00:20:37] Yeah. Kate: [00:20:37] Because no one’s probably going to hire you if you’re all over the map. Adrienne: [00:20:39] Yeah. Kate: [00:20:40] If you’re a graphic designer, like myself, when you’re a designer and you’ve spent a certain number of years designing you can design anything - I can do a logo, I can do an illustration, I can do a website. You know, all of these things… But if you get really clear on either a specific type of design, or all design for a specific type of client, you’re gonna get much better traction. So, that’s the alternate. If you don’t want to specify a specific type of work, specify a very specific market. So, if you love to do illustrations - but you only like doing really feminine, girly, flourish type illustrations… you want to focus on what is the client that likes that sort of illustration? And maybe it’s female coaches. Or maybe it’s very feminine women that are getting married and need illustrations for their wedding invite. Like, figure out who it is that is likely to want what you have, and focus all of your efforts on connecting with those people. Adrienne: [00:21:49] Yeah. So you kind of also touched upon like narrowing down on your niche there So that’s brilliant. OK. So, now people are getting a better understanding of “OK, This is like the area that I want to position myself as an expert. ” Now, it’s like, “how do I actually create a product offering for these people? How do I even build a $5K plus high ticket package or product?” Like, what are some questions they need to start asking themselves when brainstorming on that? Kate: [00:22:20] Excellent question and I’ve got quite a bit of work on this and in my online program, so I’m trying to think of how I can scale this back to just a few minutes since we’re just here together for a short while. So, number 1, you got to know who that client is and what their problem is. Right. Adrienne: [00:22:38] Yeah. [00:22:38] So a great thing to do is like figure out who your client is, and I recommend like actually creating what’s called a persona in advertising, which is like, sit down with a piece of paper and imagine this is an actual person. So, Christina, for instance, is who your target market is. Her name is Christina. She’s 36. She works. . Adrienne: [00:23:01] Why don’t we continue with the why don’t we continue with the feminine graphic designing example, and let’s kind of like, use that as a practical step by step thing. Kate: [00:23:16] Perfect. So, my client’s name is Christina and she’s getting married in six months and she wants a custom wedding invitation with beautiful flourished custom artwork. All right. If that’s my client, then what I want to do is sit down and think about what it is she’s really after and just bullet point out some of those pain points that she’s struggling with this wedding that I could help with. [00:23:42] So, yes, she wants the invitation but then what about place cards? Maybe I could do a custom illustration for that. Maybe when they do the presentation at the wedding and we want a custom illustration for that. Right? Think about what it is that you can offer her, that would make her happy and make her life better and make her job better - whatever that is, and put together a package. And that’s your high end package - it has everything in it, right? And then your low end package is, like, “what’s the minimum thing that you could put together that would solve this person’s pain point?” And those are your three packages - I recommend having three packages to start of whatever service or a solution you offer for your clients - and that’s a high, medium and low. Adrienne: [00:24:27] Mmm hmm. Kate: [00:24:27] And then in terms of setting your pricing for them, what you could look at - what I like to look at - is what it’s really worth. So for freelancers - freelancers typically work for businesses, versus consumers. And that means there’s usually more money to be had there, because businesses understand they need to spend money to get what they want. And so what I like to do is look at the value of what you’re actually offering. So for this case, we we’ll talk… we’ll pretend that we’re going after that copywriting market. I love to use this example. If you’re doing copywriting for, let’s say, your client, your target market, is retail and you write really great T-shirt descriptions. Kate: [00:25:11] That’s all you do. 24-hours a day you write descriptions that sell T-shirts on websites for online sales. And so what you can do is, you can do the math on that, and you can say OK… So if I write these great descriptions for these T-shirts and it results in one extra sale a month - just one - one extra sale at $20. Well. times that by 12. What is that? That’s $2000 a year I’ve made this company with that that one line of text, which means that my single paragraph T-shirt description is worth $2200 per year. And it really puts into mind what your services are worth. You know, stop selling yourself on an hourly basis if you’re working as a freelancer or a consulatnt Adrienne: [00:25:55] Yeah. Is that a big no no to you? Kate: [00:25:57] Absolutely. Adrienne: [00:25:58] How Come? Kate: [00:25:59] I mean it’s great for when you’re getting started in terms of setting a baseline for what you want to earn, because you do want to figure out what it actually takes you to do. So you should be tracking your time… But what happens when you bill yourself hourly, is you become a commodity instead of a solution. And people take it for granted, and again, you’re not focused on value. You’re probably not going to get to six figures if you’re selling yourself hourly. Adrienne: [00:26:26] Gotcha. I had a follow up question earlier that came to mind, but I feel like you kinda explained it… But I want to give a little bit clarity in case other people are wondering about it too. So, what I was thinking about, like putting together packages, was like, do you just create like customized packages for people as you meet them, as you discover what their pain points are, and what they actually want from you? Or like, do you create like, preset packages and hope they fit into it? Kate: [00:27:03] You can do it either way. So a great way to do it, and the way that I did it, is I create sample packages, and then I do custom bids. So, what I recommended as a designer, and what I recommended six figure freelancers, is come up with some sample packages. Because what that does - on your website, in particular - when you’re getting leads through your website, which is important if you want to travel the world like I did. Is by creating a sample package, they get a better idea of what you can and cannot do, or what problems you solve - so create sample packages, and even sample pricing. Kate: [00:27:35] So I’m a big fan of the “starting at” pricing. Again, it gives them (potential clients) an idea, without locking you into a specific contract. And the other thing about -there’s a lot of controversy about whether you should have pricing on your website or not - I am a fan of pricing on your website as baseline pricing or sample pricing, because it gets rid of the people that are super cheap and are not willing to pay. And so you don’t spend a lot of time talking to people who don’t value your service. Kate: [00:28:06] I’m an introvert, so I would rather not be on the phone with people that have no interest in paying my fees. If you’re an extrovert and you love to talk to people, when you’re early on, don’t put pricing and you’ll get a lot more calls. But anyway, sample packages are a really great way to do it and that’s what I did. I had three sample packages - you know here’s a sample base package, here’s a sample high-end, done-for-you, you get every single thing you want… and your sample pricing. But, once I actually got them on the phone, which everything you do online is really about having a conversation, you’re warming them up - once you get them on the phone, do a custom bid for them and use software for that. I use BetterProposal. io is my new favorite. There are a number of really great tools out there for creating a comprehensive proposal. Adrienne: [00:28:55] What was it called? Sorry I missed that. Kate: [00:28:57] I use betterproposals. io. There is also - I used to use Bid Sketch and I know a couple of people that use Proposify. But, anyway you can create a really nice proposal that talks about why these people should work with you, what they’re going to get, a Statement of Work is usually good, and then you can break down the pricing in a number of ways and you can give them options. upsells are a really great way to enhance your bottom line as well. Adrienne: [00:29:33] Mm hmm. This is like, so much like, nuggets of good advice. Sorry. I feel like people are like “OK, like, I. starting to figure out how to package these…” What would you say for somebody who’s feeling like, “how do I put in a value into these packages to actually price it at $5k plus, and feel comfortable and confident going into those sales conversations? To say… “Yeah, this is the package, this is how much it’s worth. ” And like, standing in that. Kate: [00:30:00] 100 percent. Yeah, I mean it’s important to do the work beforehand to really understand your market, and that’s going to tell you whether or not this person is going to value your skills. The other thing, is I have a sales coach that I work with. He’s amazing. His name is Matthew Kimberly, and he likes to tell a story about the Thousand Dollar burger. And the idea behind that, is you don’t know what somebody will pay, until you try and sell it… And so you can put a thousand dollar price tag on a burger and maybe it’s insane and nobody will pay it. But maybe there’s somebody that wants your thousand dollar burger - so don’t underestimate what your services are worth. And if you know your clients, you understand what they need and you know how to talk to them in their terms. Kate: [00:30:45] And again, focusing on the pain points and the outcomes that they want - not the things they’re getting - not the commodity. So, what is it that you’re really delivering with your service? Are they going to get an increase in sales? Are they going to get an increase in leads? Particularly when you’re working B2B, everything comes down to… they’re gonna get more money. That is why businesses exist. Businesses exist to make money, period. Adrienne: [00:31:14] What are your recommendations for like, artists? Where with like, art, often times the value isn’t necessarily more money, it’s kind of like… more of an emotional return, or you know, if you have a fine artist… your space feels more. . Brighter, more fun… Kate: [00:31:35] A hundred percent. So, with artists it is a little bit different, and it’s a little more subjective as well. So you want to focus on the feelings, and the emotions, as well as the investment value potentially - if you’re a fine artist and you’re doing higher-end, really high price point stuff. That connection is really more of a personal connection. People buy high end art either as an investment, or because they relate to the artist, and then so that actually is an interesting little thing… Kate: [00:32:06] You want to build a personal brand. Like, Andy Warhol didn’t sell $5000 paintings because his paintings were amazing - they were lithographs of soup cans, right? This was not unique. But Andy Warhol was really unique. And people wanted to be a part of his world, and they wanted a part of his world on their walls. So, look at how you can distinguish yourself, or how your artwork is different than others. And again, it’s all about understanding who your client is. And so for artists, your client is a little bit different… You know, it may not be that they’re trying to solve a particular pain, but they want to feel a certain way. They want their home to feel a certain way. They want to, you know, maybe they are modernists and they want really minimalist and high end, or maybe they are, you know. . more homey and they just want art on their walls that is coastal, and colorful. Right? Who are your people, and where are they hanging out? And what is it that they’re after - it’s all about understanding your audience. Adrienne: [00:33:14] So, how would you… what recommendations would you have in terms of like, how do we quantify that into a price and a package? Any recommendations? Kate: [00:33:25] You know, I’m not a fine artist, so I can’t pretend to price art well… but, I think, again, it’s understanding your audience, and what their budget is, and what they’re willing to pay to feel the way that your art makes them feel. Adrienne: [00:33:40] So what are some actionable steps that people can do to help discover what their market is willing to pay and stuff like that? Kate: [00:33:49] Talk to as many people as possible in the in the market that you feel is yours. Kate: [00:33:55] And so, if you can get yourself into a gallery, and you can be there and you can actually talk to people that come in - you know talk to them and make an offer and see how they respond. That’s one. If you’re, if you have a website with your art, and you’re getting people that are contacting you about them, make them an offer. And see what happens. You know like, it does take a little bit of testing, but you have to be making offers to sell - in order to find that out. Kate: [00:34:26] You can look - unless you’re in it you’re creating a new genre - you can look at other artists in the market that are doing well, the artists that you look up to in your field - what are they selling and how did they get there and what are their prices? And you can use that as baselines, and maybe you’re not as well establish from a branding standpoint - you’re newer to the field, your prices are probably not going to be there yet - but you can you know say “well, if he’s selling that type of work for $5000, maybe I can start at $2500. ” And build from there. Adrienne: [00:35:00] Awesome. Awesome. I feel like for some people, because of the question we’ve been really trying to answer is “What do freelancers really need in order to land now like $5K client?,” I feel like for some we’ve just given them a lot more questions to think about. Kate: [00:35:16] Yeah, well the number one thing to figure out with a $5K client is who that person is, and what you have to offer them. That’s number one. And number two is talking to as many of those people as possible. Adrienne: [00:35:27] Yeah. Kate: [00:35:28] And that’s what you really need. Everything in business is designed to get you a conversation with somebody that is a potential client. You know, that’s what all this marketing stuff - all the online crap that we see about building a funnel and building an email list and building social media - all of that - ALL of it is designed just to warm people up to be interested in potentially having a conversation with you. That’s what online marketing is. Adrienne: [00:35:51] Yeah. And for those that are feeling anxiety, like “Oh my gosh, I’m going to have to do all this work…” It’s like, you’ll be surprised. Just have those conversations, and you’ll have so many aha moments that it’ll be like… “Oh, OK. This is a piece that I really need to make sure is in my package. Oh this piece? Not so much. ” It doesn’t seem like it’s hitting home for some people, and you’ll be surprised when you do have these conversations with people. They’ll essentially build your packages for you. Kate: [00:36:21] Exactly. And then I have a super quick exercise you can do in like 30 minutes to an hour - to think about who your potential first client is or how to test this. Super simple. Take a pen &amp; paper. It’s important to do it in pen and paper and not on the computer. I don’t know why. There’s just a brain - paper thing. Adrienne: [00:36:40] Okay. Kate: [00:36:42] But, sit down and just make a list of 100 people you know that you could potentially ask for a referral, that you could invite them to work with you, that you’ve talked to in the past, just 100 people that you personally know. Just dump that out on paper out of your brain. Yeah. Adrienne: [00:37:03] So, family friends. . Kate: [00:37:05] Family, friends, people you used to work with, people you currently work with, people you’ve been to events with or MeetUps. Yeah all of it. Just write them all down. And then, once you have as many people as you think you can possibly write down, go through and circle the five people who you think would be the best candidate to work together - or who could refer you to somebody that you would want to work with - and get in touch with them. That’s your third piece - write ‘em an email. Don’t go straight for the sale. You just build the relationship. You sent them a text and say “Hi, I’m thinking of you. How you been?”. Adrienne: [00:37:37] Yeah. Kate: [00:37:38] Boom. That’s like, the fastest way to start marketing your business, your services, your art work, whatever it is. Start with those warm lead - warm leads are the people that know you and like you already - they want to either work with you, buy from you, or help you. And if you have a conversation with somebody in they’re like, “It’s not really my thing, but I want to support you. What can I do?” You say “Well, who do you know that might want X, Y or X? Adrienne: [00:38:07] Yeah. Kate: [00:38:08] And it’s important to ask it that way - don’t say “well if you can think of anybody…” You say, “who do you know?” Because that question - that WHO - triggers them to actually start going through their mental Rolodex and thinking about who they could send your way. Adrienne: [00:38:25] Mm hmm. Yeah. I’m even thinking back - I did like video marketing years ago. Now I’m like transitioning to working with artists and creatives, hence the show. But, I remember the first time I landed my first $5K plus client, and it was… So, my parents are business owners, and they work in the real estate space, and so it was actually a really good friend of my dad that ended up being my first $5k plus client. This was somebody I had known for a couple years already. So we were good friends, and then I started doing video work for my dad’s company, and then… the people involved in my dad’s company saw my work, and then they would go to different events and they would just talk about it, talk about it, and then yeah… Then my dad’s friend was like “Oh I love your work. ”. Adrienne: [00:39:17] He was such a fan of what I was doing, and it was kind of just a conversation - just relationship building - I never even looked at them like a price tag. It was actually like “Oh wow - like you wanna buy my services?” Like, I was kind of shocked at first, because I was just starting out, and there was this pretty extensive video package we ended up like brainstorming together and then after that first conversation, I was like “OK, now I know exactly what you want. . Let me like sit on this and come up with a package for you,” and then so that’s what I did. I took some space, I figured it out… And then we had another meeting and I was like “OK, like this is like my quote. ”. Adrienne: [00:39:53] And then I was kind of sweating about it because it was a lot of money… And I was thinking “I don’t know how this is gonna go…” But I think another key thing, that you were mentioning off air, was this idea of like pay-in-fulls and giving a discount doing pay-in-full or doing a payment plan. And I did something like that - I think that’s what I did - it was a big hefty project and I was like “Well, if you pay the $5K up-front you get basically a grand off. . ” And… Yeah yeah, you package it right? Kate: [00:40:33] Yeah you package it, and you can break it down too. So, you know, if you are offering high end services, you can maybe break it apart and say “If you want all of these things…” Like for me, with websites, it’s like “Well, if you want me to do the copy, and the graphics, and the SEO and all of that…” I build them out separately on the bid, and they can choose. Kate: [00:40:53] They can provide me copy if they want to save $500 bucks, or that sort of thing… So there’s a lot of different ways to to break that up but, 100 percent - I think you nailed it there when you kind of talked about figuring it out as you go. I think you can’t emphasize that too much when you’re just starting out people. Creative people - we tend to be hyper-critical and a little bit perfectionistic in some ways, and we over complicate everything. Kate: [00:41:22] I mean, I can’t tell you the number of people that have come to me and been like “well, I have some people that said they want to work with me… but I don’t have a package ready for them. ” Are you kidding me? You have people asking to work with you, and you’re turning them away because you haven’t pre-created a package? Adrienne: [00:41:39] Oh my gosh. It’s just. . You just threw money away. Kate: [00:41:42] You’re just throwing money away. But that’s what we do… and we do that sort of stuff all of the time. I get people that come to me and say “Well, I’ve had this website ready to launch for three months, but I don’t have the three blog post that somebody told me I had to have. So I haven’t launched it. ” Launch the site! Adrienne: [00:41:58] Yeah. We just keep coming up with reasons not to do it. Kate: [00:42:04] Yeah… and that’s all about that mindset. Adrienne: [00:42:05] Yeah. Kate: [00:42:05] Mastering your mindset is - from a long term standpoint - I honestly believe that your mindset is the number one thing that is going to make or break you as a business owner. Adrienne: [00:42:16] Yeah. Yeah. Kate: [00:42:17] People that haven’t learned how to master their mindset - to do things even though they’re scared, or it’s not perfect - and act anyway… People that don’t understand that you’re gonna make mistakes, you’re gonna screw things up, you’re gonna have bad days, and you’re going to want to quit… Adrienne: [00:42:31] Yeah. Kate: [00:42:32] They’re gonna leave. They’re just gonna quit. They’re gonna go back and get a day job and they’re not going to stick to it. They’re not going to try something new. It’s like that old Thomas Edison quote - he didn’t fail a hundred thousand times, he learned one hundred thousand things that didn’t work. Adrienne: [00:42:45] Yeah. Kate: [00:42:46] And that’s a big part of their mindset and running a business… is just keep going and you know adjust your approach as needed. Adrienne: [00:42:54] Yeah. And on that note of talking about keep going…. I wish we could keep going with this interview, but we’re running out of time so I wanted to give you a chance to let people know about your six figure freelancers accelerator program. Adrienne: [00:43:12] And Kate is actually is so generous. . she’s giving you guys - just exclusively the ones tuning in today - a 14-day free trial of her six figure freelancers accelerator program. Do you want to talk about that really quick? Kate: [00:43:27] Sure. Yeah. So Six Figure Freelancers is my passion project. It’s something I started while I was traveling with Remote Year back in 2017. I kept meeting these super talented creative people that could not find freelance clients, and I was like “Why is this so hard for you?” And then looking back, of course -of course, I had had that struggle myself when I was starting. I had just figured it out by that point… So it was like “Why are you not… Anyway, I created this program initially as a 12-week program for landing your first big client. Now you get lifetime access if you do upgrade to a paid account, so you can take your time with it, but it is designed to help you work through that six figure freelancers formula - your mindset, your business plan and marketing plan, positioning, creating packages, setting your prices - all of that is included in the program. Adrienne: [00:44:16] Yeah. Kate: [00:44:17] And yeah I have hooked you guys up with a 14-day free trial. You’re welcome to look at everything in the program - you get full access right now. We’ve got some exciting new stuff coming in 2019, but… You’ll get full access for 14-days with no credit card required. And then if you decide to upgrade, I’m going to give you a nice little bonus… If you pay in full, you will get $500 dollars off of your enrollment fee. Adrienne: [00:44:41] Yeah. And here’s the thing that I love - because you’re doing what you’re preaching right now. So if you guys still had more questions about packaging, like go check it out… see how she put things together, see how the offers are made… start looking at the world a little bit differently. Adrienne: [00:44:57] And then, I want to add before we really wrap up here, this is gonna give you access to more than 30 videos. I think there’s 70 bite-sized lessons in there as well, and it’s all about growing that six figure freelance or consulting business that you can run anywhere. Like you, Kate, have been able to travel nomadically because of this process, and I don’t know ‘bout ya’ll, but I want to be able to travel nomadically and have a six figure business going… Kate: [00:45:26] Yeah it’s pretty, pretty amazing thing. And I’d just like to emphasize as well that if you do decide to join me in the program, you know, it’s not just an online course. It’s not academic - where you’re going to watch a lecture and then everything’s going to magically work. This is a coaching program, so it’s just going to guide you through actually doing the work of building a business. Adrienne: [00:45:45] Amazing. Amazing! OK, looking at the time, we really got to wrap this up. Kate: [00:45:50] All right. Adrienne: [00:45:50] Is there one final note that you want to leave the creatives? Kate: [00:45:56] I want to let you know that no matter where you are in the process - no matter your experience - you know, if you set your mind to it, you can create the business that you want from your creative gift. Kate: [00:46:09] Creativity is one of the most powerful gifts we have in the world. And if you are blessed with it, you are lucky. BUT… You gotta learn how to think like a business owner as well, to really make a profitable business happen for you. And you totally have that capability. So, whatever struggles you have had in the past, or fac the future, do not give up on your dreams. You are worth it and you can do it. Adrienne: [00:46:35] Beautiful. I’m fired up. I don’t know about ya’ll, butI’m fired up. And on that note, stay inspired, stay motivated, and stay on your grind because the world needs that special gift that only you have. Thank you so much Kate. Kate: [00:46:51] Thank you. Adrienne: [00:46:53] And thank you so much to everybody tuning in. That wraps up this masterclass. And yeah we’re gonna get out of here and live our best thriving artist lives. Kate: [00:47:08] Woot! Design a life you love, baby. [00:47:08] Our six figure freelancer lives. [00:47:13] 100%.

    "body": "2019/03/05 - Alright guys! Let’s talk about money! Yes, you too, in the back! We need to talk more specifically about how you feel about money, and whether you are okay receiving money or not. So about a year ago, I was taking a course with a coach and he talked about “receiving”, and it made me feel literally ill. Something about that word bothered me. Turns out, I was not open to receiving. Can you believe it?! Since that day, I have spent a lot of time removing that blockage to move forward into an abundant life &amp; business. The exercise I’m sharing with you are some of the key things that helped me - and now my clients - move forward into abundance. What I’ve learned is that your mindset is incredibly important in your ability to earn and hold on to money. I’ve have a pattern of earning a lot of money, then overspending and losing everything. And I could not step out of that cycle until I took the time to look at how I actually feel about money. How do YOU feel about MONEY? Do you feel your heart opening or closing when you read that word? What’s your history with it, and your current situation? It is super duper duper important that you are honest with your answers. Now, pretend that you are ultra ultra ultra wealthy. We are talking Jeff Bezos kind of wealthy. What you would do with that money? Your answers will bring clarity to what is really important to you and how money-making relates to your personal values. Taking care of your family or friends, contributing to the world, having more fun or taking better care of yourself will all point in different directions of WHY money is actually important to you - and will influence how you spend (or save) money. Another cool thing with this list is that it will guide and motivate you when you start to lose steam in your business. Last but not least, why do you deserve to be rich? And you do! You absolutely do! Even if we haven’t met in person, I believe that you deserve to be rich and I also believe you’re capable of it. And when you get rich, you are going to make other people rich in a lot of different ways as well. You deserve to be rich and my hope for you is that you will have figured out WHY, after having read this article and asked yourself these questions. See, that money-talk wasn’t so rough, was it?

    "body": "2019/03/01 - Writing out your Dreams to Set up GoalsAlright, so you have decided to start a business and have a vision of where you want to take your entrepreneurship. There is a fun exercise designed to add excitement to your career vision: a bucket list, if you will. Have you always thought a bucket list filled with experiences like “swimming with dolphins”, “spending a year in India” or “meeting Ryan Gosling” was completely unrelated to your business? Think again. The reason I like this exercise is because as an entrepreneur, your business becomes your life, in a way… Therefore, putting together a list of things that you wish to experience - integrating those into your long-term goals as part of your MOTIVATION - is crucial to living the life of your dreams. Suspend disbelief for a few moments and pretend that you’re a kid again…  Nobody has told you that anything is impossible yet.  Nobody told you that you couldn’t make money doing what you love.  Nobody has influenced your personal beliefs or values.  Nobody has led you to believe you HAD to live a certain way. You can still go to the moon as far as you are concerned. In that state, let’s uncover some things that maybe you’ve forgotten you wanted to do and list the hell out of it… Get out a pen and paper (yes, old-fashioned, I know) and create your bucket list: Category 1 - Your personal goals  What do you want to learn or experience in your life? Which skills do you wanna master or emotions do you wanna master? Who do you want to be as a person?

    "body": "2019/02/25 - One common misconception in business is the compartmentalization between personal and professional life. As much as you try to deny it, your life and your business are intertwined… Esssspecially as a business owner! Balance is a verb ya’ll, not a state of being. I get it, though - you want to set clear barriers so work doesn’t take over your ‘me-time’. And that’s fair! What I am talking about today is integrating your life’s vision into your business. See? That sounds more like anyone’s ultimate goal. So you won’t have LESS personal time by coupling the two… You’ll have more of it! One way to ensure that your vision is aligned with your personal values, goals, wants and needs is to set time to include those into your strategy. Because more alignment in your career = more fulfillment. Today is an opportunity to undo a little bit of old training and start to focus on what’s really important to you. This is one of the first things I do with my private coaching clients and it’s my favorite part. So to give you a taste of my exercises, I encourage you to get out into nature, or find a quiet space if you’re not able to get out to nature and then ask yourself this question: If money wasn’t in the equation, would I still be building this idea or chasing this dream? Answer that question on a piece of paper or a notebook. Old fashioned, yes - but it triggers your reticular activation center and stimulates your brain. Actually, according to a neuroscientific study discussed on Forbes, “__people who very vividly describe or picture their goals are anywhere from 1. 2 to 1. 4 times more likely to successfully accomplish their goals”. And this exercise also helps to ensure you’re chasing YOUR dreams, not your parents dreams or doing something you think you should. Should is a dirty word. Erase it from your vocabulary. Once you’re sure that your on the right path, ask yourself: What would your perfect day would look like? That includes both your business and your life, of course.  Do you wake up at 6:00 am and finish work at 2:00 so you can go pick up your kids? Do you sleep in till 10:00 and work until 8:00, then meet your sassy boyfriend for dinner? What sort of freedom do you want? Where do you live? Where do you work? How many people do you employ? Or do you not?You get the ideas - create your perfect day, and with that vision in mind, you can start making minor improvements that are going to get you closer to where you want to be. If you want more exercises like this, and support building your service-based business, I’d encourage you to grab my Ebook, designed to get you started on creating your freelance business and the life of your dream!

    "title": "Miami Beach Business Coach: Coming Soon!",
    "body": "2019/02/22 - I’m a Miami-Dade County type of girl. This may shock some of you, almost as much as the fact that I listen to Justin Bieber &amp; Luke Bryant with gleeful abandon &amp; joy (without shame) It’s a bit of a surprise myself, but I digress. . Over the last few months I’ve been considering moving to South Florida and, inevitably, no matter who I spoke with I got the same party line. “I don’t think you’ll like Miami. You should checkout Fort Lauderdale. Or Boca. ” So, after driving across country, I did. I like Fort Lauderdale, but I have to wonder - what is it about me that inspires people to think “this girl needs to live in a white enclave next to a Costco?” Is it the tattoos? The fact that I spent the last two years traveling through 20+ countries? That my Spanish sucks? I don’t know… Fort Lauderdale is lovely, but today I visited Miami &amp; Miami Beach. AND that is my vibe. I’m in LOVE with Miami. Everyone was telling me that FLD was more “low-key,” but that’s not what it felt like to me. I mean, you could die in traffic trying to get the damn Publix in Ft. Lauderdale. I could walk to the Whole Foods in South Beach from an apartment. Maybe I have a different definition of low-key. When I say low key I mean chill. Easy. Good vibes only. Low drama. Give me gritty, give me artsy, give me culture, give me cafes… give me some DIVERSITY. I love that shit. Like I love Law &amp; Order reruns*. Anyway, here I am STILL learning new things about myself. Everyday. Like, I love Miami. And I STILL lend waaaay too much credence to other peoples opinions. Isn’t it amazing when you realize your hunches were right the first time? That you’ve always known what was best for you. Yet, how easily do we ignore or discard our intuition because we’re influenced by others? One of the things I do as life &amp; business coach is help clients tap into their internal GPS and acknowledge what is actually right for them. Not what’s right for mom or cousin Mary or Penny down the lane. We ALL know what we want, deep down. We FEEL it in our bones, or our guts or heart. But we bury those feelings and tell ourselves stories. Listen to your elders / friends / family / THAT guy because “They” know better. They MUST know better because they are older / wiser / smarter / more experiences / more successful / insert adjective here. But it’s all just BS we tell ourselves. THEY don’t know what is best for YOU. They likely mean well - but just because something is true for someone else doesn’t mean it will be true for you. My friends LOVE Fort Lauderdale and Boca Raton, and they are lovely places - I can see why. But… maybe because I’m weird, or maybe some of my friends just really, REALLY love Costco in a way I don’t, I’d rather be in The City. And that’s okay. But I sure am glad I didn’t sign a lease up North. Because, just as I suspected months ago when I started thinking about moving, Miami is the bomb. I mean sure - hurricanes, gators, face-eating, bath-salt smoking junkies and out of control iguanas are all possibilities here. But it’s totally my jam. Viva Miami! Now I’ve just got to find an apartment &amp; furnish it &amp; start my life over as a “former” digital nomad. Fácil. See you soon, Miami. XOXO, Kate *True fact: I’ve seen every episode of the original &amp; SVU, many twice and was easily able to navigate NYC when I visited solely because of my L&amp;O experience. P. S.

    "title": "Thinking of Starting a Six-Figure Business? Master Your Mindset 1st...",
    "body": "2019/02/06 - So, you’re interested in starting a six-figure business? One you can run anywhere… where you don’t have to answer to a crazy boss, or sit in mindless meetings or file TPS reports? You might have landed on this page after searching for ways to start a business, or how to get started freelancing, and you’re probably looking for a bunch of magical tips for making bank. Look, I’m proof that it’s 100% possible to achieve your dream… and I’ve got a tonne of tips for you here on the blog, BUT, if you really want to start a six-figure business, there is something critical you have to do before anything else. There is ONE thing that separates high-successful business owners from the broke-ass freelancers, and that difference lays in… * Drum roll, please *: The Mindset. Yes, you read it right. I am not going to drown you with numbers and administrative tasks to get you started. Step one is right there in your head. In fact, learning and mastering that little muscle in between your ears will not only help you start your business, but it will help you have a lot more fun growing your business. “So Kate, what do business owners do differently than typical freelancers?”  You might ask. Well… It’s pretty straightforward: let me introduce you to the three major traps that business owners face and the keys to getting your mindset right from the start, so you don’t have to fall and waste precious time. We are talking about building a business, here. Give me a B, give me a U, give me an I, an L, a D! Business Owner Trap No. 1: #hustlemode: Broke-ass freelancers and small business owners typically run around shouting about how busy they are.   “I’m hustling, I’m working my ass off chasing the dream. I’m working 20 hours a day. ” They take pride in the amount of time and energy they spend biding for work on sites like Upwork, Fiverr and whatever freelancing platforms kids are using nowadays. Sure, you can get to six-figures doing gig work &amp; taking on MORE clients - in fact, I recently saw someone on TikTok post about making $400K on Fiverr - but you will not have any time to enjoy those spoils. You’ll have no life. This particular person works an average of 70 hours per week - EVERY WEEK - in order to make that money. No vacations. No life. A) Are you really starting a six-figure business just to be trapped at your home desk instead of a corporate offer? B) There is a better way. You can make big $$ working LESS than 40 hours per week Truth is… what these hustlers are actually doing is job hunting over and over again. Not scaling. Not building a brand. Not thinking strategically. They are working harder, instead of smarter.  Turn that hustle mode off (Sorry, Gary V. ) !! Rather, spend some time aside building your own brand. That dedicated time will eventually lead to fewer clients, who pay your more, and require less effort. By setting yourself apart, clients will come to you as the expert that you are. And your marketing will resonate &amp; stick, so you get better results with less effort. Business Owner Trap no. 2: Selling Your Skills: Freelancers tend to sell their skills, because that’s what we’re taught when building a resume or a profile. But Business Owners take it one step further by thinking strategically… Because from clients’ perspective, skills don’t speak as clearly as solutions do. Which problems are they dealing with and how do we offer to solve them? What do you think appeals more to clients: “I can build brochures and create logos”? or “I can make you look more professional and get participants to attend your events” Flip that switch and you’ll get one step closer to that success-leading Business Owner mindset. Business Owner Trap No. 3: Letting Emotions Control You  : Managing your emotions and your business go hand and hand. As a business owner, you cannot be a slave to your emotions anymore - fear in particular! This is something that I’ve struggled with, and I still see it all the time with my clients. The “I’m having a rough day” or “My boyfriend broke up with me”  are NOT valid excuses to put your business activities aside for a moment. To be successful in starting a six-figure business, you have to learn to keep your personal feelings in a separate drawer. I myself am a survivor of abuse and a recovered alcoholic - I understand first hand the anxiety and overwhelm that comes from trauma, low-self-esteem and doubt. But I am living proof that your past DOES NOT equal your future. I’ve moved forward and transformed my history into an amazing freaking life - YOU CAN TOO. I once heard Tony Robbins say:  “There is a part of you that might be hurt and that part of you might always be hurt, but that part of you does not get to run your business. ” Right? One way to compartmentalize your emotions would be to write down specific examples where perhaps fear, perfectionism, overwhelm or feelings of not being good enough held you back from building the business and the life that you love. Keep in mind that good business owners are always taking inventory - even emotionally! By knowing where you are, and what you have on-hand, you can start to predict where you’re going. And with that list at hand, you will start paying attention to those emotions moving forward. And you can create an Alter Ego to deal with the emotions that hold you back. For instance, “Little Kate” can get emotional when the time comes, while “Big Kate” takes care of the boss stuff. Seems a little goofy I know… But it works, trust me! If you’re serious about starting a six-figure business you can run anywhere, say “Hell YES!” to yourself and grabmy book, Secrets of a Six Figure Freelancer now. Not only will I help you make the mindset switch from broke-ass freelancer to abundant business owner, but I’ll give you the actual steps for starting a six-figure business and growing into the #selfmade boss you dream of being.

    "title": "3-Steps to Starting a Business You Can Run Anywhere",
    "body": "2019/01/21 - Hey guys! This month, I am celebrating my four-year anniversary as a business owner (this is totally something to be celebrated!) and I’m coming off 2-years of travel as a digital nomad. I thought I’d share a few tips on how to get started if this is your dream too. I really got started as a business owner just because I wanted to work from home and to travel more. Initially, I started working remotely for my company, but I quickly realized that what I actually wanted was to be my own boss… So I quit the job, started freelancing, moved across country to Savannah and loved working from home, taking Tuesdays off to go to the beach and making my own rules. Then an opportunity to join Remote Year came about. I’d already dabbled a little with traveling a few months at a time, when I working remotely - but this was a chance to experience the world in a way that most people will never experience. I wanted to be a digital nomad. And an entrepreneur. And thus my coaching business was born, around the same time I kicked off 2 years of full-time travel in more than 20 countries. It’s not been an easy journey - in fact, it’s been some of the most challenging two years of my life - but also the most rewarding. So, if you’re thinking about starting a business, traveling as a nomad or making any other major life changes, here are a few things you can do: Step 1 - Get Inspired: Way before Remote Year even existed, I read a book called The 4-Hour Workweek. I’m sure you’ve heard of it. In the book, Tim outlines a process he calls “Dreamlining,” in which you think about all the things you could possibly want and what it might really take to acquire them. Maybe thats starting a business, maybe that’s using your salary to take private jets, maybe that’s retiring at 30. The idea is the same - learn to optimize your life and business - like cutting out meetings you don’t need, decisions you shouldn’t have to deal with, etc. - in order to maximize your results. Do the 20% of stuff you really NEED to do, in order to get 80% of the results you WANT. It’s a great book (that and Vagabonding by Rolf Potts have basically become “Nomad Bibles”), not so much for the realism of starting a business and working 4-hours a week (not likely for many early on), but because Tim opened a lot of eyes to what was POSSIBLE. Being INSPIRED to what you COULD have, is a great way to decide what you really want. So, start visualizing your life the way you’d really like it. What does your day look like? Your week? Your house? Do want to find a great job, or are you keen on starting a business? Where do you work? Pretend you’re in Kindergarten and daydream for a bit. Believe it or not, creating a vision for your life (and/or business) is actually a really powerful tool. I encourage to to spend a few moments thinking about what you really want to manifest for yourself this year. Then look at your current life. How far away are you from what you want? What’s a simple thing you could do today to get a little closer to your dream? Do it or schedule it. Step 2 - Decide &amp; Prioritize: Want to change your life? Start by making a decision, committing to making it happen and then doing the work. It really is as simple as that. You already thought about what you wanted, now it’s time to COMMIT. You’ve been dreaming about starting a business so you can travel or have more time? Great! A lot of people do. But are you ready to commit? Are you willing to work everyday to turn your dream into a goal? Are you prepared to say no to anything that is going to take your attention and energy away from that goal? Think about it long and hard. And if the answer still is yes… Congratulations! You’ve made it to Step One of starting a business! This seems stupid simple, but it’s actually the hardest step that most people never take. Which is why so many people are living live by default - working their 9-to-5 til they are all wrinkly, looking back at opportunities lost and regretting they were too scared to actually make a decision. Step 3 - Take Action &amp; Figure It Out As You Go: Once you’ve figured out what you wanted, made your decision and committed to making it happen - it’s time to ACT. When I decided I wanted to travel more, I committed to taking at least 1 international trip per year and a couple domestic trips, and I knew I would somehow use my experience to inspire other people to change their lives. I didn’t know exactly what that would look like, but I started taking action anyway. I started a blog. I started a freelance business. I started sharing more. I started planning trips when I had extra money. I started minimizing my “stuff” and cutting expenses so that I could travel even more. I decided to start another business. I hired a business coach. I started reading a book a week… yada yada yada. Less than two years later I was living out of a suitcase, traveling the world as nomad and working as coach. All because I made a decision, committed to working my butt off, and took action. And I continue to do that every. damn. day. So, what do you want? Make a commitment to making it happen. Do something about it today - no more excuses. You’ve got this! XOXO, P. S. If starting a freelance business that’ll let you travel the world is on YOUR manifest list this year, I want to invite you to check out my Ebook that covers what you need to know to put your plan into action.     "

    "title": "Thinking of Getting Started as a Digital Nomad?",
    "body": "2018/09/11 - Here’s what you need to know… and a bit of a rant, really, for anyone thinking of hiring a coach, joining a group or starting a business. I’m a business coach, and I’m location independent, and I tend to work with people who want the same lifestyle. But I don’t call myself a “location-independent business coach” because, well, there are a lot of douchebags out there who are calling themselves coaches, but in reality know Jack and Sh!t about business. The digital nomad lifestyle seems to be THE new hotness right now and the market is saturated with people offering courses in how to be a digital nomad… Something no one over the age of 10 needs a course for. The people putting out these courses are often (no, not always) people who had no business experience before starting their info-product business on how to be a digital nomad. Before they launched that course they were eating ramen in their dirt cheap apartment in Chiang Mai. Which means they are the LAST people you want to hire for help if you’re looking to start a profitable, long-term business. Basically what I’m saying is that you need to do your research if you’re going to hire a business coach. Make sure said coach has either built a business like the one you want to build OR has experience guiding others to get the results you want. Ensure that they have experience or certifications to back up their claims, good testimonials and that you TRUST them. Trust is key when hiring a business coach, as you will ONLY get results if you’re able to be fully honest with your coach, and willing to do what is suggested of you. As for getting started as a digital nomad, here’s the free course:  Find a remote job or start a business you can run online Sell your shit and pack your bag Pick a country and book a flight Go, and don’t overstay. It’s really IS that easy… What makes it hard is your fear and overthinking everything. Personally, I spent 6 month perfecting my packing and buying all the things… Only to get to Asia and throw half of it out. Turns out, there are stores everywhere, and no, you don’t need a year’s worth of birth control and allergy pills or 14 pairs of shoes. You don’t need that super-amazing 100 compartment case for sorting your toiletries or a suitcase with a phone charger in it. You probably should consider bringing a power strip to plug in all the electronics, and make sure your bag is under 25kgs. Pack light, buy local, and have fun. All that said and done, there is absolutely nothing wrong in investing in a life or business coach who can help you through the fear, help you get shit done when you’re travel lagged or help you figure out WTF you want to do with your life. And there are great communities &amp; travel programs out there you can join as well, like Jason + Travs Location Indie, Remote Year, Outsite, Wifi Tribe, Hacker Paradise or Nomad List. Just be sure to do your homework before you spend your hard earned funds on a teenager who got lucky with their course for becoming a digital nomad. Dead serious about starting your business?

    "body": "2018/08/09 - Want to learn how to how to make six figures as a freelancer? Meet the creative pros who’ve done it in the Six Figure Freelancers Expert Series! This week we bring you a digital interview Christina Thelin, a brand strategist and marketing expert. From identifying and filling customer needs via research and insight development to developing targeting and strategic brand positioning, she lead integrated B2C and B2B global brand strategy and marketing plan development across financial services, tech, and CPG. What makes Christina a Six Figure Freelancer?: I work with brands to drive accelerated growth through the development of a powerful global brand identity. I partner with them to deliver bottom-line business results with award winning brand strategies and marketing plans, rooted in my experience at several of the world’s top brands across an array of industries. From identifying and filling customer needs via research and insight development to developing targeting and strategic brand positioning, I lead integrated B2C and B2B global brand strategy and marketing plan development across financial services, tech, and CPG. My love of teasing out the threads of brand storytelling and experience across brands make me unique. How long have you been in business and what inspired you to start you business?: I have always wanted to own my own business. After building a successful brand and marketing career at a few of the world’s top brands, I took an entrepreneurship class during my MBA program that inspired me to start my own business. I no longer wanted to report up through an approval chain, rather I wanted to be the decision maker. I also wanted to work across new industries. Consulting allows me to do that while staying at the top of my marketing and branding game. If you came from a corporate job, how did you deal with the fear of leaving a stable paycheck?: The fear is real. What pushed me over the edge was getting accepted into Remote Year, which allows you to work and see the world at the same time. I figured that if things didn’t work out, I would at least have a year of travel and adventure behind me. I saved up enough funds to live the same lifestyle I was used to living for a few years so that I would not have to worry about going into debt. What, specifically, do you do? Who do you work with and where?: My specialty is helping small to medium businesses build award winning brand strategies and marketing plans through the development of brand storybooks, brand identity logos and design systems, and establishing brand targets. I also offer marketing communications planning and digital and social media planning services. I am based in Los Angeles, CA and service West Coast based clients. I currently work out of my home and occasionally co-working spaces. What is your top piece of advice related to your area of expertise?: My top tip for creating a strong, relevant brand is to always think audience first. If your brand was a person speaking to your ideal client, what would their story be? Who are they, what do they sound like, what are their likes/dislikes? Be as specific as you can. Once you know who you are, you will know where you need to go, or not go. How did you get started in business? What are the first steps you took?: The first thing I did was create a business plan and website using Squarespace. I also registered for an LLC, but I don’t think that is 100% necessary out of the gate. Once the basics were in place, I reached out to friends and family letting them know about my services and immediately received emails from former colleagues and classmates requesting my services. So use those networks! How did you get first client &amp; how did you get your best client?: A friend of mine from business school works at IDEO, and they needed an expert on social media marketing. I was available to join the initial client call, and things started to grow from there. At this time, all of my business has been from word of mouth through friends and colleagues. How do stay motivated or deal with fear or stress?: The key for me is not focusing all of my effort in building just my consulting practice. I realize that, in order to be my own boss, the first thing I try might not become my ultimate bread winning paycheck. I’m currently doing a mix of brand consulting work, book writing, and building out my online business INA + ILIA. Meditating has changed my life whenever I feel stressed. I’m also a big fan of yoga. How do you stand out from the competition? What do you to differentiate yourself from other people in your area of expertise?: I have a really broad corporate background as well as startup experience so brands trust that my recommendations are well rooted and thought through. While I am a big thinker, I also follow through and get things done. My clients know this and are, therefore, always ready to work with me when the time comes to problem solve tough brand or marketing problems. What are your top tips for people thinking of quitting a job to start a business?: The toughest part about starting your own business is being your own boss and staying disciplined. I hired a fantastic coach, Kate Bagoy, to help me stay focused and on task when things seemed too overwhelming. What is you favorite book, blog, podcast or other resource and why?: I love the podcast Sidehustle and Girl Boss. My favorite books include Tools of Titans by Tim Ferris. I’ve also found The Artist’s Way by Julia Cameron to be life changing. What business tool or online software could you not live without? What makes it easy to run your business?: I love freshbooks to keep track of expenses using their app. I’m also a huge fan of squarespace for building professional looking websites without killing your budget on web design. What do you like most about running your own business?: Managing my own schedule. What’s next for your business? What do you have planned for the next year, or what big goals are you tracking on?: Given I’ve just returned home from a year of building my businesses while on the road, I’m looking forward to super charging my consulting business, meeting new clients, and building out INA + ILIA. What else is important that we haven’t asked?: You don’t know until you try. Being a thinker and a strategist, I tend to overthink everything but you won’t know how things will workout until you try them. Stop thinking. Start doing. _________________________________________________________________________ About Christina Christina has an extensive  background in building global brands across several Fortune 100 brands including Procter &amp; Gamble, Visa, and Twitter.

    "body": "2018/08/02 - Want to learn how to how to make six figures as a freelancer? Meet the creative pros who’ve done it in the Six Figure Freelancers Expert Series! This week we bring you a digital interview Becca Kennedy of beccakennedy. net, a Psychologist, Design Consultant &amp; UX Designer. Becca turned independent and co-founded a UX consulting company called Kennason in 2015 out of Albany, NY. Currently, Becca is the UX Designer for Agrilyst, an agriculture-tech startup based in Brooklyn. What makes Becca a Six Figure Freelancer?: I’m an expert in my own experiences and my own unique combination of skills. My expertise continues to evolve because I am always learning and trying new things, so the term “UX” doesn’t quite cover it all, but it’s the closest thing! Maybe what makes me stand out is that I stay on this roller coaster — I keep improving both my UX skills and my knowledge about running a business. I have a lot in common with fellow freelancers who struggle. My mistakes continue to teach me as much as my successes do. Part of the reason you can call me a Six Figure Expert is that I stay on this roller coaster — I keep improving both my UX skills and my knowledge about running a business. What can you tell our readers about your background?: I came from academia and eventually moved to consulting. I’m from upstate New York, and straight after college I was accepted to a PhD program in Human Factors Psychology and moved to Norfolk, Virginia. I worked in a university lab where we studied cognitive issues in surgery, and we researched and tested simulators designed to help train surgical teams. A few years into that program, in about 2011, I realized that User Experience (UX) was an area of design that used many of the same concepts from Human Factors. Alongside my PhD work, I started peeking into UX conferences and meetups and realized I had a lot more fun there. My PhD program was grueling, like most PhD programs are. Financially, I also lived off a modest stipend for those years. So, after I spent five years on graduate coursework, research contracts, and PhD qualifying exams, I reached a personal breaking point and I moved to Albany to undertake my dissertation remotely. I don’t talk about this very often, but I was burned out and broke and emotionally crushed and wanted to live somewhere I love. The first and only Human Factors job I found locally was a research staff position at an engineering college, which was not ideal for what I wanted, but I applied and accepted it. After getting my bearings in Albany by attending a ton of events and meeting people, I decided to start a UX design business with two partners. I’d realized that since I’d decided to make Albany, a small city, my permanent home, the only way I would be happy with my career is if I created my own. How long have you been in business and what inspired you to start you business?: I’d actually wanted to start a business for about five years before it happened. I’d very casually talked with people who had started UX companies to find out how it worked. My loose plan was to finish my PhD and then work a cool job for a bit first, but that’s not what happened. I co-founded the business while I was still working on my PhD dissertation. I really jumped in because of a need for money and a desire to do something huge to kickstart things. In a way it was nice, because I never left a cushy job or great benefits for my venture. I was already used to living on little income and working really hard. So, it’s been slowly uphill from there. I’m really grateful for a career I can control and I’m grateful for the amount of stuff I learned in my 20s while I was really scrappy and falling on my face. What, specifically, do you do? Who do you work with and where?: I’m a User Experience (UX) Researcher and Designer. I’m also a Human Factors Psychologist. That means I use my expertise inhuman cognition and behavior to inform product design. My ideal clients are startups and small businesses who are passionate about solving problems and doing social good. I’m based in Albany, NY, but my clients can be almost anywhere! I work from home and I love it. I really like working with clients who are starting a UX process from scratch. I like teaching others how to use research methods and human-centered design thinking. What is your top piece of advice related to your area of expertise?: Designing good experiences means you have to get to know users or customers. If you aren’t actually researching and talking to these people, you really are not fully doing human-centered design. That being said, there are a lot of things like web accessibility that are just good practice and don’t involve user research. Another big tip is that UX is not only about digital products — this is a recent assumption because a lot of designers started working in UX from web and software design, but experiences can be physical products or spaces, too! How did you get started in business? What are the first steps you took?: I got started with zero business knowledge. And I really mean zero. It’s almost embarrassing! I had been deep in academia, which is a totally different world. I learned a lot through trial and error and fighting for learning opportunities. I am still learning all the time. I really recommend taking some kind of entrepreneur boot camp, if you can. I did this recently and I wish I had done it when I was first starting a UX design business. My boot camp was two evenings per week for a few months. It was offered by my local Chamber ofCommerce. Take advantage of affordable resources around you! And don’t be embarrassed like I was about how little you might know upfront. If you are passionate about what you are doing, you will learn! You have to jump in and start trying things to really get anywhere. How did you get first client &amp; how did you get your best client?: The answer to both is word of mouth! I’ve gotten a lot of work from having positive relationships with others who work in my field or complementary fields. What marketing strategies have been most effective for you?: I’m not huge on marketing tricks, but what works for me is writing helpful or informative articles about UX (I am a writer for What UsersDo, which was recently acquired by UserZoom) and giving talks and workshops at conferences and events. By sharing pieces of my expertise, I am building trust with others and low-key promoting myself. Some of my best leads have come from people who have seen me speak publicly. How do stay motivated or deal with fear or stress?: It can honestly be really hard to deal with fear, stress, and setbacks. I suggest making friends with other freelancers and consultants, and genuinely support one another. When you need to take a break, try to take a break. Your physical and mental health are important and taking care of yourself is beneficial for your business in the long run. How do you stand out from the competition? What do you to differentiate yourself from other people in your area of expertise?: One thing that sets me apart is that I’ve been doing Human Factors and UX work for over 10 years, which is actually quite a longtime compared to many UX Designers. Although UX comes from a history of other disciplines, UX as a buzzword is still really young! What are your top tips for people thinking of quitting a job to start a business?: Definitely know that there will be huge ups and huge downs. A support system of others who are in similar shoes to yours is critical, in my opinion! And of course, try to keep your expenses down and try to have some savings in place before striking out. Some things, like having a website ready, can be done while you’re still working your job. What is you favorite book, blog, podcast or other resource and why?: I really recommend UX Team of One by Leah Buley! I also find Amy Poehler’s book “Yes, Please” to be pretty inspirational and fun, so I think I’ve read that three times. What business tool or online software could you not live without? What makes it easy to run your business?: Honestly, Twitter and Slack are my world. What do you like most about running your own business?: I love choosing the companies that I get to work with, and I like having the flexibility of working from home. What’s next for your business? What do you have planned for the next year, or what big goals are you tracking on?: These days I am working in a full-time role that I stumbled upon at just the right time, and I love it! I also work on small consulting projects and I do freelance writing for UserZoom. Right now, I enjoy that I can pick and choose meaningful clients and these clients give me extra income. I really needed this kind of security after a bunch of years in grad school and then consulting. In the meantime, I’m continuing to learn new skills and slowly increase my value and rate, so that when I eventually return to consulting full time someday, I’ll be way leveled up. What else is important that we haven’t asked?: Just keep swimming. _______________________________________________________________________________  About Becca  Becca Kennedy is a healthy mix of science and creativity — she is a Human Factors Psychologist and a User Experience Researcher/Designer.

    "body": "2018/05/10 - Want to learn how to how to make six figures as a freelancer? Meet the creative pros who’ve done it in the Six Figure Freelancers Expert Series! This week we bring you an interview with Zafira Rajan, a communications strategist from Vancouver, Canada who specializes in working with high-impact brands. What makes Zafira a Six Figure Freelancer?: “My business sets itself apart by offering three key services that most clients scramble to find several contractors for: copywriting, graphic design and high-level communications strategy. In order to bring a full project together, I’m able to seamlessly move between all these fields to deliver high-quality content for my clients, while being a single point of contact who can critically analyze every angle, execute and evaluate.  As a result, the one thing my clients constantly tell me is this: “you make my life so much easier!”” Watch the Interview Here:: More from Zafira: How long have you been in business and what inspired you to start you business?: I’ve been an entrepreneur for three years, but dived into being a full-time freelancer in January 2017. I never thought I would end up running my own business! What started out as small side projects blossomed into a strong referral network that paved the way for me to success. I always knew the 9-5 life wasn’t for me and once I started freelancing full-time, it became clear very quickly that I’d made the right choice. If you came from a corporate job, how did you deal with the fear of leaving a stable paycheck?: Having consistent income was always something I needed - until I realized that I would be happier being my own boss! I started by scaling back my full-time job to a part-time, one year contract in the same organization that would still benefit my career. That was my commitment to myself: to use that one year to build up my portfolio and client list while bringing in a stable income. By the time the contract ended, I was well-positioned to take on running my business full-time. What is you favorite book, blog, podcast or other resource and why?: I’m a huge fan of The Copywriter Club podcast! If you write any kind of copy, it’s a fantastic resource for learning more about how other copywriters structure their business, deal with clients and achieve success. What business tool or online software could you not live without? What makes it easy to run your business?: I’m a huge nerd when it comes to software that helps my business run smoothly! Right now, I enjoy using: - Wave for invoicing - Bidsketch for proposals - Toggl for time tracking - Calendly for booking meetings - Google Drive for collaborative documents What do you like most about running your own business?: Being able to work from home and manage my own time are the biggest perks for me! I am an introvert by nature, so I couldn’t ask for more - going into an office everyday drained me and now, I’ve never been so energized! It’s also a huge gift to be able to make the most of my time, and work when it’s productive for me. What’s next for your business? What do you have planned for the next year, or what big goals are you tracking on?: I’m working on rolling out some new copywriting, design and strategy packages this summer! After one year of running my business full-time, I finally have a better idea of the problems my clients need help tackling with, and I’m excited to design new services that will help them where it counts.  About Zafira: Zafira is a copywriter, graphic designer and communications strategist in Vancouver, Canada with roots in Kenya and bits of her heart in Sweden. When she’s not writing copy, she’s probably watering her growing collection of plants or curled up with a book and her Labrador husky, Mars.

    "body": "2018/05/10 - Want to learn how to how to make six figures as a freelancer? Meet the creative pros who’ve done it in the Six Figure Freelancers Expert Series! This week we bring you a guest post from John Schreiber, creative director turned entrepreneur &amp; a self-described human Swiss Army knife He’s created, consulted and provided design strategy and consumer insight to many global brands like Nike, Coca-Cola, Starbucks, Apple, and others for more than twenty-five years and now teaches meditation in Portland at www. euthymiamind. com.  “In the long run we only hit what we’re aiming at. ” John Schreiber: Anthony Robbins said, “Committing yourself to long-term results rather than short-term fixes is as important as any decision you’ll make in your lifetime. ” And I’ve been uncommonly fortunate for many opportunities to chase passions both personally and professionally, from startups and campaigns in business to Ironman triathlons and ultra-marathons. My modus operandi and ultimately my results have always come from some simple strategies and few but simple rules. Strategies for staying focused and motivated in pursuit of long-term goals. While it’d be cool to make this post one big lengthy word burlesque with a final reveal, I’ll just come straight out and say it. Success comes from consistent right effort over time. That’s pretty much it. Maybe you hoped for something more esoteric like a fact I drank Bulletproof coffee every day or read like a gazillion books a year with the help of a speed reading app. Nope. Just the right actions applied daily over days, week and even years. It’s true of most expeditions. It can be hard to accept; I get it, I do. We live in a hyperbolic and consumer-based culture that promises; hell even demands immediate results from 8-week abs to paying off your debt in a year schemes. Everything is sexed up from yoga to water these days - to make it sound healthier or more supercharged than it likely is. (see Hot Yoga and Smart Water. ) And every day we’re celebrating, it seems, a new ‘overnight’ millionaire. It’s intimidating for sure and the reason most people want to quit before ever getting started. It might be why long-term goals seem more daunting and more difficult than ever. So how do you stay motivated then – through these comparisons and inevitable plateaus or setbacks even? How do you weather lack of support, criticism or worse, self-doubt? #1: Tune out the hype. Call bullshit!: Stop comparing yourself to others, especially the 30 under 30 or 40 under 40 narratives. Be happy for them, as you should always be of other’s success but they’re the outliers (see the Malcolm Gladwell book by the same title). They’re the lucky ones, not the norm and as someone who’s met many “overachievers” let’s say don’t buy into the myth – at the very least, it’s certainly not worth wasting time comparing yourself to them. The author Ann Voscamp said it well, “Comparison is a thug that robs your joy. ” But more than that, comparison can make you a thug who beats down others - or your soul. Truth: When I signed up for my first Ironman, not only had I never attempted a triathlon before, I couldn’t swim – more than doggie paddling 20 yards at the most. Comparing myself to anyone else at this point would have been a nonstarter. Start from where you are. Because what other choice do you have? #2: Be specific and be (mostly) realistic: Know exactly what your intended outcome is. By specific I mean make it measurable. Saying you’re going to lose weight is not precise. But declaring you’re going to lose 20 pounds of fat and add 5 pounds of muscle in six months and keep it off for a full year is. This specificity will not only help you identify precisely the action items, KPIs, and behaviors you’ll need to reach your goal, it allows you to track progress and celebrate moving that needle one step closer to success along the way. Also, Quantitative benchmarks counter our usual dysmorphic tendencies. Dreams are fragile things, especially in the beginning, and it doesn’t take much to kill them. Even an off day or the smallest disapproving nod from a respected friend can crush our confidence if we allow it. Get stats on your side. Don’t subject your dream to subjectivity. It’s a killer. And it probably goes without saying but be honest in your abilities. That’s doesn’t mean not stretching yourself because if the goal requires no growth in the process, you probably would have achieved it years ago. A good goal should scare you a little and excite you A LOT. ” – Joe Vitale. But if someone’s already achieved what you want then it’s likely you can too - if only by simple modeling. Then remind yourself that those that have reached what you’re after have the same 24 hours a day, no more and no less. They have to sleep, eat and shit just like you. And though we may all start from a different place or with various advantages, our potentials are virtually equal. #3 Now Burn a bridge. : In ancient times generals were known to burn the bridge once their armies had crossed to give them no choice but to fight since retreat was now impossible. Turning back or quitting as an option was off the table! Our egos are bad things, right? “Ego sucks us down like the law of gravity. ” - Cyril Connolly. Or maybe not. I call it ego judo. Why not leverage yourself with it? Tell others about your goal, especially those that will hold you accountable. Go ahead and let your mouth write a check that you now MUST cash lest you look bad. It’s so convenient that you never tell others of your dream to write that great American novel because no one will call you out when you don’t – and you won’t. Last summer I made a goal to run over a dozen marathons and half marathons in different national parks – that came out to more than one every other week and more than 20,000 miles of driving. So the first thing I did was make a large image of all the parks I intended to conquer and post it on my Facebook page for all my friends to see. Now I had committed. And while some might call it bragging, as Muhammad Ali famously quipped, “It’s not bragging if you can back it up. ” #4: Practice the 80/20 principle: The reason you don’t get more done is because you’re doing too much. You don’t need to do everything, nor can you; trying will only burn you out and lead to inevitable discouragement. What you can do is identify those actions and behaviors that will bring you the most return on your investment. It’s common for many businesses that 80% of profits come from 20% of their customers. About 20% of drivers cause 80% of accidents, and you likely wear about 20% of your wardrobe 80% of the time. The point is every action is not equal, some will have a far more significant impact on our result than others, and those are the ones to focus on like a laser. Identify those actions that will give you the most significant return on your time or resources. Every day that you’re lucky to wake up there are going to be things that are in your control and things that aren’t. Unfortunately, most people waste considerable time even if it’s thinking about those things that are not in their control. Stick to what you can influence and after that stick to only those actions that will have the most significant impact or take the least effort. Said a million times, and it’s true, don’t sweat the small stuff. #5: One Bite at a Time. : That’s the cheeky but profoundly right answer to the question, ‘How does one eat an elephant?” Small choices, decisions, and actions over time will not just give you incremental gains towards your goal – They’ll give you compound benefits! Like interest on your money, consistent small steps over time provide significant results in the end. With that 80/20 mindset, you can now identify those small actions, habits, and decisions you’ll make every day. Come up with no less than ten things that will move you towards your goal. Ten small things over days, weeks and months add up to 3,570 small steps and actions over a year. It might be three cold calls to new prospects every day or just one note of thanks to a current client or even a friend. Maybe yours is 20 pushups, a 10-minute walk or even 5 minutes of meditation. One could be as simple as drinking a large glass of water, one of the easiest, cheapest and most proven ways to lose and maintain body weight. Here’s an amusing recent example of this idea. Years of training my body to go far in a straight line have wreaked havoc on my flexibility, and I’m embarrassingly tight in some areas. I asked my coach and a good friend if we could address this as I didn’t want to be sixty and fit but unable to tie my shoes. I asked for the most aggressive stretching program we could design and what was the best yoga that’d turn me into a human contortionist worthy of the carnival. His advice was this: Stop using furniture. Yes, stop using the furniture in my house. Get off the couch and sit or squat on the floor when I read, relaxed or watched TV. Sitting on the floor in different positions without support he explained, would stretch my lower back, open my hips and force me to use better posture as well. He also encouraged me to take my stairs two steps at a time, because as we age, we tend to shorten our stride and further limit mobility. I’m not ready for the Cirque du Soleil yet, but the results have been nearly miraculous. #6: Addition by Subtraction: Eliminate the obstacles. We could spend countless hours making the list of all the things we need to do to succeed in our pursuit of a goal. But as necessary are identifying those actions, habits and yes, even people that undermine our best efforts. Willpower is a myth and if you don’t take steps to eliminate these gremlins from your environment, they WILL derail your dreams. If your goal is to lose weight, you have a much better chance of success once you remove all the sugar and processed food from your kitchen than if you think you’ll be able to reach over that bag of Oreos several times a day while retrieving the cottage cheese. And while you’re at it, limit your time with people who don’t actively support you too. Lastly, edit without mercy those things that suck your time, one of our most precious resources and the something you’ll need most of while you’re focused on those new habits and actions. Maybe you’re a news junkie or find yourself clicking away for updates like a lab monkey at the feeder bar on any one of the several social media options available to us. You may have to wait until the very end of the day to see that latte and scone your friend from high school, the one you haven’t seen in thirteen years snapped today, but you’ll have to sacrifice. #7 Self-signaling: Most of us think we make choices because of who we are. But this is not the case; we are who we are, in part, because of our decisions and the actions we repeatedly make. In psychology, this is called self-signaling. And I’ve already touched on some decisions in #3 and #5, but there’s another area that needs addressing if we’re to get leverage on our goals and that is our environment. We are shaped by environment and by the people we decide to spend our time. Period. The ‘5 People Rule’ and the science that supports this is a familiar anecdote to many involved in personal development. Whatever your goal is, you MUST seek out and spend time with others that have already achieved what you are working towards, be it health, wealth, or relationships. Who you spend your time with is one the most significant determinates of long-term happiness and success. I used to keep this African proverb by my desk years ago when I managed larger teams: “If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. ” Who you decide to spend your time with is as important, maybe more, than any of the actions or tactics you apply. #8: Ready Shoot Aim!: Start, and I mean now. Right now. I once told a mentor about a big audacious goal I had a few years back. I told him of my five-year plan for it too. He smiled and without hesitation asked if I had a five-year plan or was it a one-year plan I was waiting four years to begin on. Long story short, we achieved it in less than a year. For some it’s fear and others it might be paralysis by analysis but waiting for that right moment or more information or more skills isn’t serving you. Life is finite and short at that. “Memento Mori (“remember you will die”) is an ancient stoic phrase used to remind us that time is a gift and not to be wasted. What are you waiting for? We Buddhists often remind ourselves, “The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now. ” #10 Keep Your Grip Loose. : In professional baseball, hitters know that keeping a loose grip on the bat improves bat control, but more so it increases bat speed, which increases power. Loose muscles are fast muscles. You might think that by squeezing the sawdust out of the bat, biting down and flexing your arm muscles, you can hit even a ninety-five mile per hour fastball. In actuality, the reverse is true. Tight muscles are slow. The tightness inhibits other muscles that you don’t even realize you are using. Ok, so now imagine your goal as that bat. Get the picture? If you’re rigid in your pursuit or too narrowly focused on the horizon, you’ll miss new opportunities to learn and grow along the way. Be flexible and willing to make adjustments because you WILL need to make adjustments. And stay relaxed too because if you’re not enjoying yourself, you’ll flame out; you’ll lose your drive and motivation before you reach the finish. And one last sobering reason to keep it loose; after all the dreaming, planning and work, you still might not achieve that goal. That’s right – at least not in the exact picture-your-mind sense of the word. While all the aforementioned tactics will give you the very best chance for success, there are never guarantees in life. The fact is we can only control our actions but not the results. It’s a pithy axiom but correct; shit does indeed happen. You will, however, achieve great things and likely beyond your expectations. Bruce Lee said, “A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves merely as something to aim. ” Because the real reason we strive for goals isn’t for what we gain but for who we become along the way. I began this list with a note of gratitude about all the passions and goals I’ve been fortunate to pursue in my life. I never said I succeeded every single time. But the growth, insight and perspective gained from these campaigns was worth every second of time spent, every ounce of effort and even every setback. Even had I known the outcomes in advance, I would still do them all again. Every single one.

    "title": "How to Get Your First Client With 6-Figure Designer Brian Kappel",
    "body": "2018/05/03 - Want to learn how to how to make six figures as a freelancer? Meet the creative pros who’ve done it in the Six Figure Freelancers Expert Series! This week we bring you a digital interview Brian Kappel of spacemonkeydesigns. com, a visual artists, designer &amp; agency refuge. From retail design to customization and event ideation, Brian has brought his passion for design and his drive for unique experiences to projects for over a decade. What makes Brian a Six Figure Freelancer?: Great question, and one that I constantly wrestle with. I think what separates me from others, or what makes my clients come back is my obsession with turning out the best work in the shortest amount of time possible. My years in the agency world helped me to understand the pace of the work necessary to keep things moving forward. I don’t compromise the integrity of the quality of “big ideas” I just self vet concepts in order to arrive at a solution that not only check the boxes for the client, but exposes other thought tangents and opportunities that those solutions may create. I don’t say NO much, and I don’t miss deadlines. Clients often ask what my sleep habits are, and in reality I wouldn’t call them habits, as there is no pattern. There are times that sleep is plentiful, and other times, it is a short break between projects. Expert Freelance Interview:What can you tell our readers about your background?: I have a degree in drawing and painting. Visual arts has always been my thing, and in reality when I graduated from college it was a transition period from analog to digital. I came out of school in ‘98, I think I worked on Photoshop 1 and Illustrator wasn’t around yet. When I got my first job at NIKE, instead of a design role, I started as a production artist. I created line art, schematics, and basic catalog layouts. This was really invaluable because it taught me the software, but in creating schematics for the apparel graphic designers, I learned how good designers create graphics. It was a kind of on the job training that I needed. What I brought to the table was this blue collar approach of “Get SH*T done”, so I was taking on large amounts of work. The deal I struck was that if I finished my PA work, I could work on graphic tees, and I became one of the only production artists who actually had tees going to market, as a couple of great designers mentored me, and made sure that my designs were getting in front of the right people. From NIKE, I realized there was a bigger design world out there that I was not getting exposure to, so I made the somewhat gut wrenching decision to leave NIKE and jump into the agency world. This move forced me to develop appreciations and skill sets in not just 2D design, but 3D design, and most importantly acquiring an appreciation for how ALL disciplines work together. Holistic design solutions are like a well crafted sculpture or piece of architecture, no matter how you approach it, your interaction is well curated and thought out. My entire professional career, I have done freelance work. Working after hours, late into the night, or early into the morning, or the nights where they ran into each other, allowed my wife to stay home with our kids. Just as important though, it taught me to hustle. This piece is vital in the freelance world. You have to always be hustling, not just to hit deadlines, but to take the time to innovate your approach, build your ethos, try, fail, try again, and fail harder. It is the dance that you have to be ready to do in order to be a freelancer. When I got to a point in my career that I had good solid connections, in a variety of places, doing a variety of work, I began to float the notion of my impending full time freelance status update by people. When the responses shifted from “really?!” to “I would totally use you,” i knew it was time, and I have not looked back since. How long have you been in business and what inspired you to start you business?: I got ahead of myself, most of this was answered above. It was a side hustle, but I have been in business for myself for 3 years straight. Before that I had been on my own for small stretches, jumping on with agencies when “life” out-paced my work load and I couldn’t keep up with providing for my family. If you came from a corporate job, how did you deal with the fear of leaving a stable paycheck?: Have 4 months salary built up, 6 is a better egg to have built up, but $50k in saving is fairly unrealistic. If you have kids, especially young ones, fade more toward 6, I was out on my own when in a two day span my AC/Furnace blew, followed by the hot water heater, followed by a project that flopped, and my daughter needed braces. It just about ended me, and had I not had money saved up, things would have gotten ugly. When you make the decision to jump, separate your business from your personal expenses, get quickbooks, track everything and pay your quarterly taxes. What, specifically, do you do? Who do you work with and where?: I work on all facets of design. I work on brand identity, brand building, strategic conceptual design, event design, customization, fixture design, space planning, packaging, visualization, and I still find time to paint/draw/spend time in the studio and produce everything from wooden action figures to graphic tees. I work out of my house and garage. The nice thing about technology now, I can take it all with me, so when I travel I have a laptop that keeps me connected wherever I am. What is your top piece of advice related to your area of expertise?: Since I am all over the place, I will give the advice that I give to all younger designers that I talk with. Be the authority in your field. That is not a greenlight to be arrogant, rather think of it like a creative ninja. Know your skills, and the things that you are super good at. Be honest with yourself though, rose colored glasses will get you in more trouble than good the first time you over commit, only to under deliver. Clients who hire creatives want to be reassured that who they bring in know what they are talking about. There is a certain part of peace that is achieved when a client feels like hiring you was a good idea, because through your success they will look good. Craft your words, concepts and approach so that you are inviting your clients into your thought process, and that you listened to them, but brought your perspective to the table. How did you get started in business? What are the first steps you took?: Keep your contacts, don’t burn bridges, show your value while you work for someone, so they will want to work with you after you leave. How did you get your first client &amp; how did you get your best client?: This answer is tied to the answer from above. All of my best clients are people that I worked with directly at companies, who are either in a position that they decide who to bring in for help, or they have started their own companies and need my kind of help. Treating people right breeds work, but it also generates referrals, when clients know that you will make them look good for passing your name along, it will strengthen that relationship, while building new ones. What marketing strategies have been most effective for you?: I have not had to market yet, but I am sure that time will be coming. Seeing things from the other side of the table is how I generally approach things. Think of how you would like to be marketed to. A 100 page deck would send me screaming out of a room. The way most people consumer information is in small portions. Keep your samples low in quantity but high in impact. Take credit for only the things that you do, and spend marketing meetings building a connection with prospective clients. People will call because they like you and your work. How do stay motivated or deal with fear or stress?: You have to jump in with both feet, there is no dipping a toe and only deciding to jump in when the water is the right temp. Perspective is huge, on my worst day, with zero sleep and a “To-Do” list that breaks my desk, I can still sit back and say that I am the one making the call. Being the one in charge of your destiny is where I have always found solace. I am not afraid of hard work, in fact I run toward it, but to own both the responsibility as well as the reward is what keeps me going. I have never been one who thrived while I was comfortable, I have always needed to sit on the edge of comfort and total chaos. When life leans one way or the other, I cherish the fact that I am the one in control of making sure that I get back to center, or lean one way or another depending on the day. How do you stand out from the competition? What do you to differentiate yourself from other people in your area of expertise?: I stay true to who I am. I am not for everyone, hell sometimes I am not for myself, but at the end of the day, I bring solutions that are true to my POV. I believe that is everyone’s differentiator, there is only one you. As a creative, you see things in a different way already, own it! If you find that you are copying someone else’s work, and playing it off as your own, you are not set up for bringing something new and exciting to the table. You have to always push to innovate yourself, that is the only way you will truly stand apart from others. What are your top tips for people thinking of quitting a job to start a business?: Have the proverbial ducks in a row. Think of every NON design part of the business and have a system in place so it will all be taken care of. The more work that you put into the logistics, the less you’ll have to worry about it when things come in. I hate invoicing but I have a system set up so that I know that on Fridays I do X + Y + Z, and I can go back to my creative work. What is you favorite book, blog, podcast or other resource and why?: Rework and Remote are two of my favorite business books, as they pretty much wrote down exactly what I was thinking when I was in the process of heading out on my own. It was a huge career validator. What business tool or online software could you not live without? What makes it easy to run your business?: Quickbooks, though I know I still have a ton to learn about it, I know it can serve me better than I currently use it, but without it, I would still be invoicing with Word documents and trying to keep a ledger?! What do you like most about running your own business?: I make the calls, who to work with, who to say no to, which direction to go, and when to close the office down and go to the movies in the middle of the day. It has been so much better than I ever thought it could be. What’s next for your business? What do you have planned for the next year, or what big goals are you tracking on?: Honestly, I am reaching the point in my career where I am trying to figure out what I want to be when i grow up. There will come a point where I will hand my position over to the next generation, the newer more talented version of me with a fresh perspective. I am totally content with adopting the clay hut, crazy hermit, Jedi master of advice and experience for the new wave of creatives. I would love to shift into a time that my painting and drawing dominates my time, mentoring where and when I can, as long as my crazy advice is still relevant. What else is important that we haven’t asked?: If could go back to my younger self, be it 5 years ago, or 25 years ago, I would say DRAW MORE. There is ALWAYS TIME. Shrug off the things that you take so personally, in the grand scheme they are as insignificant as the people who said them. The people who make a big difference in your life pop up in times and places where you least expect, and should be embraced as the heroes that they are. Never mail it in, even the most mundane project could lead to something amazing. Ready to stop dreaming and start doing?

    "title": "Meet 6-Figure Copywriter Jessamine Marie",
    "body": "2018/04/27 - Want to learn how to how to make six figures as a freelancer? Meet the creative pros who’ve done it in the Six Figure Freelancers Expert Series! This week we bring you a digital interview with Jessamine Marie of connect-norfolk. co. uk, who left a 17-year corporate career for freelancing. What makes Jessamine a Six Figure Freelancer?: For me, understanding the business strategy, ethos, and long-term vision of my clients is key to writing content that lands with impact. Professional copywriters will have bundles of professional writing experience, but the very best will have experienced working alongside business giants, where they have gained a sound understanding of business strategy and brand voice. I feel fortunate to place myself in this category. When I write, I write to add true value to your business, through written content that will generate prospects, leads, revenue, and profit. Expert Freelance Interview:What can you tell our readers about your background?: More than 17 years in corporate finance for a global insurance leader taught me more than I ever cared to imagine. Like most jobs, there were highs and there were lows, and during my career, I got to work with some exceptionally talented people, from interns to CEOs. I built some valuable relationships with suppliers and senior stakeholders too and wrote extensively to support the contracts that we held with them. The writing was the main element of my job that I loved, the part that put fire in my belly. Over the years I extensively traveled to support the implementation of project proposals, I saw significant change in the FinTech (Where finance meets technology) market, and through this I was at the cutting edge of associated business growth. I was considered a success in my field, but somewhere, deep-seated within me, I was unhappy. I felt unfulfilled and somewhat lost, and after much soul- searching it became clear to me that I was in an environment where the business processes were forcing me to operate outside of my core values, against what I believed in and often not in the best interest of the people around me. I knew I loved what I did, and I knew I was good at it, and so, going solo as a copywriter was the natural progressive step. Soon enough, Connect-Norfolk was born. Combining years of knowledge in Corporate finance, technology and associated legalities, I now write for organizations that are looking to further establish their brand or draw attention to current success. How long have you been in business and what inspired you to start you business?: There is something honest about doing what you do for yourself and no longer slogging to fulfill somebody else’s dream, but to follow your own. I have been copywriting for more than 10 years, I side-hustled for a bit whilst working full-time in corporate finance and then made the leap about a year later. I can honestly say that I have not looked back. Running my own business was something I had wanted for a long-time, but it did not always feel like reality, I think with age comes self-belief, clearer thinking, knowledge, and a genuine contentment within your own skin, four things that are key to running your own business. I am now internationally published across digital and print with 80% of my clients based in the US and in the Tech arena. If you came from a corporate job, how did you deal with the fear of leaving a stable paycheck?: Leaving a stable job and a regular paycheck is a massive deal, and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. Financial security allows us all to provide for our families and intern protects our mental well-being. I had a company pension, Life insurance, healthcare, paid holidays, sick pay, and many other benefits and I left it all behind. I had a little bit of money put aside which gave me 6 months to find myself regular clients and a regular income, otherwise, it really was toast and beans for dinner. It was both scary and empowering, I had made this leap, I was in control of my own destiny, and only I could make this happen. There were wobbles along the way of course, but staying focused and not losing self- belief was of paramount importance. What, specifically, do you do? Who do you work with and where?: I write! Well actually, I research, I plan, I structure, I write, I submit ‘ version 1’ and then make edits as per client instruction. I work from home in sunny (mostly) Norfolk, England, visiting local clients in their office where mutually beneficial and sometimes working from my favorite coffee house where I can quietly research whilst eating sticky -choc -fudge -cake, but that’s our secret! My ideal client? A somebody/anybody who is stuck for words, who needs a writer that is emotionally removed enough from their ‘every day’ to understand their brand, their target audience, and their key message. What is your top piece of advice related to your area of expertise?: Recognise that you only have work to do if you go out and get it. Sounds simple, doesn’t it? Sadly no one is going to drip feed you work. If you do a good job with your existing clients they might refer you to others with the potential of more work coming your way, but even when you are working hard on a content writing assignment, you still need to be looking for the next project, applying for that next opportunity, and networking daily. Now, this next piece of advice I learned the hard way and I shall say it only once, so listen carefully. Only a small percentage of interest from clients will materialize into paid assignments. There is no such thing as sowing too many seeds. When I first started out I held back on the number of pitches I placed, fearful that if they all decided they wanted me that I would have too much work, and then what would I do? I have since learned that this scenario is a very privileged place to be, but not one that happens overnight. Now there is no stopping me, I sow seeds daily, even when I am busy working, and that’s what keeps me in regular work! How did you get started in business? What are the first steps you took?: I built an eight-week business plan. I bought out my local stationary shops supply of post-it-notes and brain dumped on to them. I asked myself these five questions:  What do I need to do to become recognized as a freelance copywriter? What will my clients want from me? What legalities to I need to conform to? What will set me apart from my competitors? What will help build my reputation?Tasks were divided by week and then per day, and allotted time-frames were awarded to each task. Each hour that passed was one step closer to me making Connect-Norfolk a reality. How did you get first client &amp; how did you get your best client?: My first client? Cold calling! That’s right, hundreds of calls to companies that had no idea who I was, why I was calling, and with no knowledge that they needed my services. It’s hard work, but it sure pays off, and It was outbound call number 310 where the voice at the other end said, ‘ your timing is impeccable, if this works out you might just be my copy savior’. I still write for this client today and ‘copy savior’ is a title that I’m happy to carry. As for best client, I don’t believe in them, every client is my best client, it doesn’t matter to me if I write for them on a weekly basis, or complete a ‘one-off’ job, at the end of the day every client has decided that they need my services and we work together to deliver desired outcomes. How do I find clients? Communicate, or for millennials out there ‘network’, be it over the phone, via job apps, via social media, LinkedIn, at meetings, conferences, seminars, or at dinner with your great Aunt Doris, just talk, share, shout about what you do, be confident, and be proud. What marketing strategies have been most effective for you?: To date, I have not paid to advertise my services. That’s not to say that paid advertising does not have its merits. I have self-employed friends that rely on clients that are generated solely through paid marketing. For me, the best marketing tool is LinkedIn. When used properly it’s a brilliant lead generator. It pays to keep your connected audience (and beyond) abreast of what you’re working on, where your expertise lies, and your availability. Have a free hour in your Tuesday afternoon? Tell your connections on LinkedIn, offer a 15-minute no-obligation telephone call to discuss their need for whatever product or service it is that you are offering. I have landed many clients using this method. How do you stay motivated or deal with fear or stress?: Background noise keeps me motivated, I guess it reduces the sense of working in isolation, so the TV is often on at low volume. I prefer the radio but I end up singing whilst writing, and that creates a breeding ground for errors! Regularly speaking to people keeps me motivated too, whether to a client, a potential client or to book a hair appointment! Don’t underestimate the importance of daily human interaction. A 10-minute walk around the block to take in some scenery and fresh air often helps to refresh me for the afternoon, as does sharing what I am currently working on with my friends and family, it brings to life what I do. Rewarding myself really helps, ‘When I have finished this page I can make myself an iced caramel latte’, having a milestone in sight always helps in keeping me buoyant. The key to overcoming fear is to face it. Do the things you are scared of. My first ever client meet to discuss a potential project was super scary, do it, reward yourself for doing it, trust me, the next meet will feel much more doable. How do you stand out from the competition? What do you to differentiate yourself from other people in your area of expertise?: Experience has taught me that it’s the simple things that make a difference, and that those are often overlooked. My clients tell me that I stand out from my competitors because I do what I say I am going to do. If we have an 11 am call booked in, I call. If I promise to share a document, I send it. If we have a project deadline, I meet it. Reputation is key to the success of those who are self-employed. our reputation is built on our reliability, competence, and perception. Be reliable, be good at what you do, and ‘perception’ will take care of itself. Self-employment empowers individuals in a way that ‘being employed’ cannot, for we are the face of our brand. I speak to many potential clients who ‘might need me in the future’, my advice is to follow up that call, and 8 weeks later, follow up again. I landed a job last month and my client said, ‘we had three potential writers in mind for this job, but we are calling you first because you badger us on the phone every couple of months reminding us that you are here, we like that’. There are tens-of-thousands of great writers out there from creative students to published authors of multiple books. In my field of writing, corporate experience sets me apart. I can write effectively on processes, procedures, principles, and concepts because I have been fortunate to have been in the thick of it all and seen it first-hand, whatever ‘it’ might be. What are your top tips for people thinking of quitting a job to start a business?: Ask yourself these 8 questions:  Are you willing to work hard? The answer needs to be resounding yes! Are you doing it for the right reasons? No one can tell you what they are but follow your gut, it is rarely wrong.  Are you prepared for the financial and emotional peaks and troughs? Do you have finances to fall back on whilst you build your business and reputation? (Think additionally about your pension, sick pay, holidays) Do you have enough emotional energy and resilience at the current time? What else is going on in your life? What might stop you giving this your 100%? Can you test-run your business on a part-time basis before making the decision to leave your current job?What is you favorite book, blog, podcast or other resource and why?: Ben Settle is my ‘go-to’ for inspiration. He is a copywriting expert who has taught the methods that he’s pioneered to some of the world’s most prestigious direct marketing companies. I have lost count of the amount of wonderfully inspiring business directive books that I have read over the past couple of years. Two of my favorites are: ‘The Other 90%’ by Robert K Cooper. ‘ How to unlock your vast untapped potential for leadership and life’. ‘Hippo. The Human Focussed Digital Book. ’ by Pete Trainor with Luke Shipman. A book that will inspire you to ask questions about the world you live in and encourages us ‘not to do things better, but to do better things’. What business tool or online software could you not live without? What makes it easy to run your business?: Skype. Many of my clients are US based so Skype allows a cost-effective and simple way of communicating. Apart from that nothing too extraordinary. Word, Excel, Outlook, and Privacy Badger! What do you like most about running your own business?: Knowing that I am making a difference to someone and their organization, using well-written prose to shout about their brand, their venture, their opportunity or achievement. I love the freedom it gives me, sometimes I work until the early hours, sometimes I am up at the crack of dawn, as long as the job gets done I can plan my work around my loved ones. The Appreciation. All of my clients appreciate the work that I do for them, I am assuming that they would not provide repeat business if they did not. They have chosen to outsource their work and they know to expect quality, reliability, and that I am always happy to knowledge share. What’s next for your business? What do you have planned for the next year, or what big goals are you tracking on?: 2018 sees me under contract with some large organizations operating within the tech-space and supporting global growth across digital, FinTech, InsurTech, AI and associated Cybersecurity, with a real focus on User Experience (UX), My main goal is to stay true to my brand, with people and their organizations and the center of what I do. I am open-minded and excited by new opportunities, but even within this fast-paced digital world in which I find myself, my feet remain firmly on the ground. What else is important that we haven’t asked?: 5 years ago, I would have said, go on Jessamine Marie, you really can do this, and my message to you today is the same. Self-belief is 80% of the battle, and the other 20% comes down to hard work, dedication, and commitment. Whatever your business, stay true to and don’t undersell yourself, know your worth, and never ever compromise on the quality of the product or service that you provide. Some parting words from me: Not everyone is like you, we are all unique, clients will frustrate you and many will not operate in the same way that you do, love everyone, embrace their idiosyncratic ways, guide, support and accept them, only then can we work in harmony with one and other and maximize business potential.   Ready to take the first steps in becoming a six-figure freelancer?

This week we bring you a “Mini-Course” from Nathanael Clanton of Frontrunners. life.

See for Yourself:Business Advice That Will Make or Break You as a Creative Entrepreneur:       By Nathanael Clanton   Originally published at Frontrunners. life   “I am thinking about getting in the world of freelance graphic design work. Thinking of starting in Sydney and possibly see if I can support myself on it. Just wanted to see if you guys have had any tips, or some strong ‘Do not do this. . ’ advice. ”My brother and I recently received this message from a friend over in Australia who has been really loving the new opportunities she’s been getting for graphic design work.  Our conversation with her inspired me to write this article and expand on some of the things we shared with her because I feel that the advice is applicable not just for graphic designers, but for all creative entrepreneurs. I’ve been a designer for over 12 years, and as much as I learned in school, there’s so many lessons that you can only truly learn firsthand. That being said, I care a lot about helping other people’s growth process become shorter and more streamlined than mine, so I can save them time, stress, and set them up for greater success sooner in their careers.  This article shares some of the most valuable lessons I’ve learned in my career as a creative entrepreneur. And while some of it is specifically for designers, the vast majority of it applies fully to anyone who is running a freelance or self-employed creative business.  Dig deep and see how many of these principles you’ve already put into practice and which ones you have yet to make use of. 1. Always have a contract: You’ve got your foundation in place for sure. NEVER do a job without a contract. N-E-V-E-R. : Trust me, I’ve learned the hard way, too many times. - So no matter how in a rush your client is, take the time to negotiate the scope of your work and a price that you feel will be rewarding to you and get a signed copy of the contract AND a 50% downpayment before you even touch an Adobe program.  A contract isn’t a dirty thing, it’s an expression of mutual commitment; it protects their investment, it allows you to be able to dedicate focus to their project, and the plain fact is that it’s a standard business practice.  If they give you a hard time, I would warn you to be wary of anyone who DOESN’T ask for half down and a contract, because they’re probably not very professional.  I would recommend having a contract even with people who you know very well.  ESPECIALLY with people you know well (i. e. Friends and Family), because there’s nothing worse than letting a financial matter screw up your relationship because you guys didn’t have clearly defined parameters and expectations. Never assume that what you are thinking in your head is the same as what the other person is thinking. you can only be sure of that once you expressly write it out and then both mutually agree upon that. this is what a contract is for. A contract will provide both parties with peace of mind and a feeling of security. It allows both of you to know what to expect from each other, and gives you a reference point for all decisions, both creative and financial. 2. Get yourself a good invoicing service. : And it adds a level of credibility to your business and billing process. I use Freshbooks. : It sends a digital invoice to your client, and has lots of great features like online pay, overdue reminders, custom branding, automatic late fees, and it tracks which projects are paid and which aren’t.  People are much less likely to complain about a late fee that’s automatically charged by a computer, rather than if you were to call them on the phone and explain that their project payment is overdue.  The most useful aspect of this by far is that it helps you track which projects you’ve been paid for and which you haven’t, this is something I used to do manually which was total pain.  It helps ensure that you’re not leaving money on the table because you forgot to ask for payment.  – It also makes it much easier to collect payment because you’re no longer hassling your client through texts and phone calls, but rather an automated system is giving them reminders to pay you. People are less likely to get annoyed by a persistent computer than they are by you sending them 10 texts in a week. Don’t rely on your client to keep track of when to pay you, they’ve got more important things to focus on.  Getting paid is one of your biggest, if not the biggest, responsibilities as an entrepreneur. It is what allows you to keep doing what you’re doing, so you literally cannot afford to slack in this area. TIP:: Another way to avoid awkward payment situations is to CLEARLY define your payment schedule in the contract before you do any work.  This way your client knows in advance exactly when they need to make payments to you. I traditionally do 50% down, 25% at the midpoint (2nd round of concepts), and the remaining 25% BEFORE I deliver the final artwork to them. On smaller/shorter projects, I tend to do 50% down, then 50% BEFORE I deliver the final artwork to them. 3. Never negotiate your rates. : N-E-V-E-R. Come up with a billing rate that will allow you to provide for your basic needs, then ADD to it so that it will allow you to take care of yourself beyond your base needs. : REMEMBER, IF YOU CAN’T AFFORD TO LIVE, THEN YOU CAN NO LONGER DO WHAT YOU LOVE. : THIS IS PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF ADVICE IN THIS ARTICLE. Typically freelance design pay is higher than being on staff somewhere because you are also responsible for all the other expenses that would normally be covered by an employer (insurance, software, subscriptions, health care, etc. ), as well as the fact that you do not have 40 hours of work guaranteed each week.  If you have a client who says they can’t afford what you’re charging, DO NOT give a discount. You don’t negotiate on price, you negotiate on SCOPE. : Scope is how much stuff you’re doing for them.  If their budget is smaller than they thought, then you just adjust what you’re creating for them to fit within the budget and then they can have you create the rest when they have more budget available.  Negotiating your price down by giving discounts effectively lowers your value to people and makes them question whether you were trying to overcharge them in the beginning.  (Ex: “If she was originally going to charge me $75/hour, but I got her down to $45/hour without taking anything away, then was she trying to pull one over on me?”) Also, be realistic with yourself on how long it will take to do things. I typically take my estimate of how many hours I think it will take and double or triple it because experience has shown me that’s how long a project usually takes in real life.  It also gives you margin to work within when unexpected things come up. (Using an app to track your hours when doing a project will give you great insight into how long a project actually takes to complete, which will prove invaluable for estimating future project rates. – Check out Rescue Time, Asana, Freshbooks has one, and there are a myriad of others out there. ) Make sure that you’re not just charging bare bones for your work because you view yourself as “inexperienced”. Remember, if you are self-employed, you are running a business. Your goal isn’t to survive, your goal is to THRIVE. : If a business is not profiting, it is not going to make it. So please, don’t just charge enough to make ends meet, make sure you are charging rates that allow you to make a profit, to grow, and to progress. The service you’re providing is valuable.  And compared to your clients, you ARE an expert.  Also, if you are doing work for clients, you ARE a professional, not an amateur.  So don’t let people who aren’t designers dictate the value of your work.  Of course, charge a rate that is relevant to your experience level. Don’t go charging clients $100/hour just because you want to; you only get to raise your rates when you believe that you can provide them with a service/product that is WORTH that amount. As you grow in experience, you can begin to charge more accordingly, because you have become more valuable. : This is the same thought process I use to evaluate when my rates should go up: I look back and evaluate my growth, how much faster I’ve gotten, how much stronger my design solutions have become, how my skill set has increased, how my customer service has improved, etc. I also evaluate how I feel after a job, comparing what I charged with the time and effort I put into it, and I trust what my gut is feeling about it. Ex: “Was that job worth $2k because I’ve charged that in the past, or do I feel like I put $4k work into it?” This is a very useful practice because it gives me insight into how to price jobs and adjust my scope in the future.  I can then lead out my future proposals with my updated rate because I know that I can provide them with that level of value moving forward; and if a client has a smaller budget, then I know that I need to adjust the scope of what I’m providing.  Most of the time, clients are happy to pay my higher rates because my self-confidence gives them confidence that I’m giving them a good return on their investment;, not only that, but they can see that the service I’m providing actually justifies the rate.  And smaller clients have always been grateful to scale down the scope of a project to fit their budget because they appreciate that I genuinely care about keeping them within their parameters.  It’s a win-win. 4. People will only value you as much as you value yourself. : As a rule of thumb: Cheap projects generally take just as much, if not more, work as higher-billed projects. : This is something that over a decade of experience has taught me. I generally have ALWAYS regretted giving discounts and reducing my rates, because there’s something in me that knows I’m short-changing myself.  A project should always be a MUTUALLY beneficial relationship between you and the client, otherwise it’s a recipe for one of you feeling frustrated and ripped-off.  Charging what you’re worth allows you to be excited about the work.  It helps you do better work because you know you’re being rewarded for your effort, which creates a better end-product. Compare that to undercharging, which results in you dreading working on a project, which affects your customer service, as well as your creative flow. 5. Don’t compete on price, compete on value. : Let’s face it, there are online services where somebody can get a logo designed for $5. FIVE DOLLARS. That is completely unrealistic for making a living. Of course, the people who buy from these sites have to compromise on value drastically. : Don’t compete on price by whittling down your rate lower and lower just to get a client.  So what if their neighbor’s nephew owns Photoshop and is willing to design their logo for $100, you’re not trying to compete with that guy.  You’re providing a completely different service than that guy. If you were to envision where you land on the spectrum of designers in the market:Would you want to land on the low-end, where the price and the quality is low, or would you want to land on the high-end, where the price is high and the quality is exceptional?: It’s completely your decision how much you value yourself, and you make this decision every single time you start a new job.  Every project is an opportunity to either challenge yourself to become more valuable, or to continue having a low view of yourself.  Hint: If you take pride in your work and you know that you can’t allow yourself to do a crappy job for a client creatively, then STOP charging like you’re on the low-end! It’s not sustainable for you to put in 100 hours of work for $100, let’s just call that the Naploeon Dynamite Complex while we’re at it. You’ve got mixed priorities in that case. You can’t go low AND high. You’ve got to choose. Remember what I said: “Cheap projects generally take just as much, if not more, work as higher-billed projects. ”:  You can do ten $250 jobs and spend 200 hours, or you can do one $2,500 job and spend 40 hours. Which would you rather do? You can just as easily spend 30 hours on a $300 logo as you can on a $3,000 logo project, and the design can be the same level of quality; which would you rather have?Sure, you will most likely get less large clients in the beginning, but as you strategically position yourself as a higher-value service provider, then you will begin to get more referrals for higher-value jobs, especially if you knock it out of the park on the big jobs.  HINT: Successful clients will be your best references for future successful clients. In life, you get what you TOLERATE. : You deserve better than to work with people who won’t pay you what you’re worth just because they are cheap, and you don’t have to take a low-paying job just because someone can’t afford it – no matter how nice they are.  What those situations mean is that it’s not a good fit for you and them. In those cases you simply tell them, “It’s looking like it’s not a good fit for us”, and refer them to someone else who is less-experienced, or who would be happy to help them out at that level. Trust me, it’s worth passing on those jobs.  Unless they’ve worked with other designers, people largely don’t know what design costs, they don’t understand the value of it.  Oftentimes, people aren’t intentionally trying to screw you over, they just don’t know what design costs.  It’s your job to be patient with them and educate them on the value of the return on their investment, then let them decide if they want to make the investment you are asking for. Pricing all about positioning yourself as a higher-value designer/creative, and being confident that what you can provide is better than 80% of the other folks out there. : And if you lose jobs because they couldn’t meet you at your price point or weren’t willing to adjust their scope to match their lower budget, then that is actually a GOOD sign, that you are positioning yourself at a higher level. You will ultimately attract higher-value clients in the future, and those people tend to appreciate and understand the value of design more, which leads to a much better working relationship, and potentially a long-term, mutually-beneficial, client relationship that pays you really well. : Here are some extremely valuable resources on pricing and positioning yourself as a creative entrepreneur or freelancer::  If you’re brand new to freelancing, check out Kate’s Six Figure Freelancers Coaching program… you’ll get step-by-step advice for starting your business, positioning yourself as an expert and setting your rates.  If you’ve been a around awhile, there’s this incredible guy I follow online named Brennan Dunn who wrote an amazing book called “Double Your Freelancing Rate”, that helps challenge fears and insecurities that every freelancer encounters and he helps you change your perspective to valuing yourself and your work more, and then others begin to do it by extension. – Highly Recommend! Also, check out Paul Jarvis’ Creative Class or subscribe to his newsletter, The Sunday Dispatches. He writes about freelancing and entrepreneurship a ton, and is one of the most brutally honest and transparent people in the industry, in a good way. Also, check out these books:  “Design Is A Job” and “You’re My Favorite Client” by Mike Montiero. Highly recommend! His books are a kick in the pants and full of empathetic-tough-love. Literally every designer/creative business owner needs to read these.  “Work For Money, Design For Love” by David Airey.  “The Four Hour Workweek” by Tim Ferriss – About designing a life and living unconventionally. This redefined how I do my business and set goals for the kind of life I want to live. 6. Get help building a network. : See if there are any talent agencies in your town and register with them. : These are basically staffing agencies that connect companies who need creatives with their network of designers.  (Kind of like how actors and musicians have agents who get them gigs. ) If you get connected with them, they can send some great work your way, help you build relationships, and can be a valuable resource for knowledge. TIP: Make friends with one of the talent managers at a few different staffing agencies, they’re pretty much all really social and super-nice, and they will be more likely to put you at the top of their list for referrals. : FYI: Most big companies don’t post their jobs on Craigslist. They sometimes do on LinkedIn and Indeed, but oftentimes they reach out to the creative agencies first and ask them for specific referrals. They do this because the agencies have already done 80% of the work by interviewing and pre-screening qualified creatives for certain roles. This makes the company’s hiring process much simpler and streamlined.  So its an excellent idea to register with all the major talent agencies around town so you can gain access to these opportunities that most folks won’t ever see in the job postings.  I got two of my first big gigs out of school through a talent agency. These jobs introduced me to future clients, one of my biggest design mentors, and other friends in the industry who now work at a variety of different companies.  In the coming years, I’ve referred many other designers to them, who have subsequently found other jobs as a result. It’s a must-have relationship for every designer to take advantage of. 7. Educate yourself on pricing: There’s no single right answer for the question, “What should I charge”, because it’s relative to every creative. : It depends on your skill level, experience, the level of service you can provide, how well you can market yourself, how good you are at selling your ideas to clients, your speed, and a bunch of other factors. : If you need a reference point for pricing, it’s tough to find any specifics out there because people closely guard that knowledge. But I would say for a beginning Freelance Graphic Designer, you’d want to charge in the $30-40/hr range. Now, this doesn’t mean you’ll make $60-80k per year, because as a freelancer, you’re not going to have 40 hours of work each week.  Your annual income depends on your level of hustle, how many jobs you decide to take on, how many jobs you can win, and the rate at which you complete them.  This is one reason why you can’t charge minimum wage rates for design; the other reason being that you possess a valuable skill that can and will help your clients make thousands of dollars as a result. Disclaimer: You don’t have to tell your clients your rate. : I would actually recommend that you don’t.  This number is mostly a reference point for you to bid jobs.  Instead, bid based on the project as a whole, not by the hour. Otherwise you would make less and less money as you get faster and faster. You’d get punished for being more efficient if you billed hourly. (For more insight on this, check out the articles at the end of this section. ) So what you should do when you get a prospective client, before you say “YES!”, is have a conversation with them. : I call it a “Qualifying Conversation” - I actually have a questionnaire for it that I email them. Ask questions about the company, what do they need, what’s the timeline, what is their budget (and yes, you ARE allowed to ask that. It allows you to know what exactly you can provide them based on their budget. ), etc. Thank them for their time/answers and tell them you’ll get back to them with a quote.  The purpose of this is to find out exactly what they need, and to use that information to determine whether the project is a good fit for you.  Following the conversation, based on what they want you to design, you estimate how long you think it will take you to complete the work (including research, roughs, reviews with client, revisions, etc. ), and use that number of hours along with your hourly rate to get a total number. I like to provide my clients with three different level options::  One thats solves their base need.  One that does that plus some additional needs/wants.  And one that does everything in the other two plus something extra that could help amplify their brand. Like I said in Point 2: Billing structure is traditionally 50% down before start of project, 25% at midway, and 25% upon completion and BEFORE delivery.  When using a flat-fee approach to pricing, you have to be very mindful of staying within the scope of your agreement, because it can be tempting for clients to think that this means they can get an “All you can eat buffet” for a single price.  This is NOT the purpose of a flat fee. In order to hedge yourself against situations like this, read on to the next point. Here are some great resources for determining your design rate and pricing your work::  Double Your Freelancing Rate has a great section specifically about this Jessica Hisce has an excellent article called, “The Dark Art of Pricing” that is a great reference: Go HERE and click on the “On Getting Paid” section to find it.  Why I Need to Know Your Budget How 20 Designers Charge Their Clients 88. 2% of Business Owners Should Double Their Prices The Design Pricing Formula Pricing Experiments You Might Not Know, But Can Learn From Pricing Strategy for Creatives 42 Questions Every Freelancer Should Ask Their Clients 5 Pricing Tips to Earn More on Client Projects8. Avoid scope creep: Make sure that in your contract you are SPECIFIC about what you are creating for your client. This is your Project Scope. : It dictates what they are hiring you to do and also what they are not hiring you to do (I. E. : If it’s not in the scope, then they will need to pay extra for it. )If you don’t do this and stick to the contract, then what happens is that your client will ask for a little addition, then another, then another… until you’ve spent twice as much time on it and you’ve added a bunch of free work.  This is called SCOPE CREEP, and it’s the bane of a freelancer’s existence.  Some common reasons for this extra un-scoped work are: [Source]  The client changed their mind about the project requirements The client extended the scope of the project beyond the brief The client asked for a “tweak” without understanding the ramifications The client expected services that the freelancer had not originally intended to provide The client has not provided the required information needed to complete something The client has been slow in approving drafts despite impending deadlines The client asked for something to be finished earlier than the original deadlineMost clients don’t do this on purpose. : Getting inspired with new ideas is just something that happens naturally as a result of the creative process.  However it’s one of the most important things you have to account for when working with clients, because if it’s not nipped in the bud in advance, you can easily burn away your profit margin until, once again, you’re like our friend Napoleon Dynamite, making a dollar an hour. Oftentimes, clients get branded as being “unreasonable” or “demanding” because they continued to ask for un-scoped work and because the designer felt like they had to make it for them. : After all, “The customer is always right. ” Right? – Wrong.  The CONTRACT is always right.  It’s the “Law” that both you and the client both agreed upon before the project even started.  You are not obligated to do anything for the client that is outside the contract scope, not even a “little tweak”. And it’s your responsibility to communicate this to your client. Make sure that if they want other additions (Ex: more than 3 rounds of revisions), that you either update the contract scope, or you bill them separately for that additional work with a new written agreement. (Make sure you get their approval for that work in writing before doing anything new. ) A great way to discourage Scope Creep is to ask, “Ok I can definitely do that for you. What is your budget for these additions?”: It reminds them that more work costs money. And it helps them to stay on budget. If they ask, explain to them that you’re bringing this matter up because want to help them stay within budget.  They will be grateful for your consideration of their finances, it’s both professional and courteous.  So if they’re asking for more than they currently can afford, let them know you can do that once they have more money, or you can trade that new item in the place of something that was in the original scope. I’d like to challenge your perception of “unreasonable” clients and propose this idea (barring any extreme situations):: You don’t have “Bad” clients, you’re just doing a bad job of communicating with them and sticking to the contract. : YOU are the professional. YOU are the one who knows more about the design process then they do. YOU are the one who understands how long it will take to make certain changes. YOU are the one who better understands the ramifications of changing the creative direction mid-project. It’s not fair to the client for you to assume that they should respect the design process when they don’t even know what that process is. : You must educate them how and why it’s important to lay out the scope at the very beginning, to communicate to them the cost of additional work, and to help guide them through the process and make the best financial investment in your services where it will count the most.  The VERY BEST way to avoid most of these problems is to clearly define the scope in the contract, then to continually come back to the contract when instances of scope creep arise. 9. Make sure you take care of taxes. : It can be a huge shock paying taxes your first year of being self-employed, since it’s so drastically different from being employed at a job. : When you are your own boss, you aren’t paying taxes from every paycheck, so you can easily end up owing a HUGE amount of money when you file taxes each year… unless you plan ahead.  Here are some practices that have helped me out significantly: One of the most valuable, and profitable, skills you can gain as a self-employed business owner is to learn how to do your own taxes. : Whereas most people who work in traditional employment situations might take a passive approach to taxes, only thinking about them once a year, hiring someone to do them, and crossing their fingers for a big tax return; when you’re an entrepreneur, it pays HUGE to take an active approach to your personal taxes.  Firstly, you shouldn’t expect to get a tax return back anymore, unless you have another income. (The reason for this is because you aren’t having an employer automatically taking out taxes from each paycheck, you get to receive the whole amount of your payment, and it’s your responsibility to decide what to do with it. ) This is one of the big pain points of being self-employed, but I like to think that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks because you get to make use of your money throughout the year, and you can recoup a lot of what you owe through deductions. I’d recommend setting aside 25% of each payment you get from a client for taxes. It’s painful at first, but not as painful as owing $10k at the beginning of the year when you file taxes. : This is money that you do not spend; you have to consider it “already spent” because it’s set aside for taxes. : A good idea is to put this in a savings account and not touch it, because technically it doesn’t exist since it already belongs to the government. This takes discipline. A creative idea I’m considering experimenting with is possibly putting it into a low-risk investment account (like index funds), and seeing if you can earn some interest on that money throughout the year. (Disclaimer: I am not giving any official investing advice. ) If you make sure you’ve set aside this money throughout the year, then you can actually hang on to a good portion of it by taking business deductions when you file, as well as have what you need to pay off what you do owe.  In this way, you can essentially get a “Tax Return” by paying less taxes than you saved up – you get to keep the difference.  TIP: You can also PRE-pay your taxes throughout the year here: (LINK to EFTPS). Many business owners do this quarterly so it lessens the sting of paying a big chunk once a year. Tax deductions are your best friend when you’re self-employed. : There’s so many benefits connected to running a business and so many breaks available if you know about them.  And you don’t have to wait until your business is profitable to start writing off deductions.  It’s not uncommon that businesses take a few years to become profitable, but you can take deductions even if you’ve invested more than you made.  Don’t leave more money on the table than you have to. A wonderful tool to track your expenses throughout the year is Mint. : It’s owned by the same company that owns TurboTax, which I use to file taxes myself. You can connect most types of accounts (Bank, Credit Card, School Loans, etc. ) and Mint will track every transaction, deposit, and debt across all your accounts and automatically categorize them.  Then, when you file your taxes, you have beautiful graphs and totals that are already calculated for you, rather than having to hand-sort thousands of receipts.  This process literally reduced my tax-filing time by 75% this year. So rad! I like to think of doing taxes as one of my most profitable days of the year. : “Money saved is money earned. ” – Think about it: If you owe $15,000 in taxes and you reduce that amount to only $5,000, you literally just “made” yourself $10,000. And if it took you 10 hours to file your taxes, that’s the equivalent of $1,000 an hour! You’d be extremely lucky if you can name even one client job where you got paid that kind of money! So don’t be afraid of filing taxes; if you have this perspective, then it’s actually pretty exciting! 10. Establish balance: Finally, make sure you have a healthy work/life balance. : Set reasonable hours for yourself (even if you’re still single and have the luxury of hustling day and night). Don’t answer client calls or emails after 5:30/6pm. You don’t want to condition them to think that you are on-call at any time. Don’t work on weekends or let work bleed into your off-hours.  If you don’t have balance, then you’ll never fully shift into “Rest mode”, and that’s a surefire way to burn out. People will only respect your time and value as much as you respect it. When you provide yourself with margins in time, relationships, and finances, then you will have the capacity to actually LOVE what you do because you get to enjoy the rewards of it.

    "body": "2018/04/17 - Want to learn how to how to make six figures as a freelancer? Meet the creative pros who’ve done it in the Six Figure Freelancers Expert Series! This week I had the pleasure of sitting down to chat with Self-Taught Designer &amp; Instagram Expert Brandon Groce. Brandon has worked with Fortune 500 companies such as Disney, Dannon, and LG on projects ranging from Social Media Campaigns to Web Design. He is also the founder of GroceMedia, a Social Media Agency focused on Fitness &amp; Lifestyle brands. What makes Brandon a Six Figure Freelancer?: What makes me an expert in my field is that I am able to pull from other areas of my expertise (Social Media, PPC, Conversion Optimization) to help me and my team “design businesses. ” Not many designers have the skill sets that enable them to create a wholesome revenue-generating ecosystem. What I mean by that is being able to understand what needs to happen on the Digital Traffic side of things, as well being able to create a Conversion-Optimized website to optimally convert the leads you bring into it. I specialize in both areas of expertise, digital traffic &amp; conversion optimization. I know how to bring people to a site and give them what they came for, in a way that benefits my clients and their customers. See for Yourself:: More From BrandonWhat can you tell our readers about your background?: I am a self-taught designer that worked his way up from sleeping on the floor in a very small apartment in Dallas Texas, working my ass off on many Start-Up projects, to working with Fortune 500 Companies and starting my own Social Media Agency, GroceMedia. How long have you been in business and what inspired you to start you business?: I’ve always wanted to work for myself. I have been a hustler since the age of 9, selling drawing lessons to kids as we all waited in the classroom for our buses to arrive. Then just upgraded at the age of 16 selling design services on the internet… Now here we are 8 years later, doing the same thing just on a different scale… This is the type of thing I live for. If you came from a corporate job, how did you deal with the fear of leaving a stable paycheck?: Make sure you set yourself up for success… NEVER kill a fuel source if you don’t have to. I wouldn’t say hop all at once unless you’ve covered all your bases in order to account for a nosedive in your plans. I’m not talking about a “plan B”, I’m talking about a strategic plan you have to keep yourself afloat while you craft your business. Building a stable foundation for your business is KEY. Set yourself up the best way you can from the beginning. Set up your own rigged game. What, specifically, do you do? Who do you work with and where?: I work with Fortune 500 companies and more specifically Fitness &amp; Lifestyle brands on projects ranging from Social Media Campaigns to Web Design. What is your top piece of advice related to your area of expertise?: If you are already proficient in one skill set, start to touch/investigate other skill sets that are parallel to your own. Start to branch out and see how your newly mastered parallel skills can help advance your primary skill set. How did you get started in business? What are the first steps you took?: Figure out WHAT your business is. Figure out your brand, your offerings, services, target audience, etc. From there, all your answers to who will buy what your selling, what you need to build, etc will be answered for you and you can make action plans on how to get/make those things happen. How did you get first client &amp; how did you get your best client?: I got my first client from someone coming across my work on the internet. The came across my portfolio, loved what I did and was about and It went from there. My best client was also a referral, work I had done for a fitness model was within the social circles of my best client. The fitness model referred me and my team to work for my “best client”. My best clients tend to come from referrals mainly because there is already a level of trust in my team’s abilities. Also, people tend to find me and my work primarily via Instagram. So, for those who don’t have a large of a network as mine. I would prioritize these things:  Online portfolio - Even if you don’t have client work, make your up your own concepts and present your capabilities.  Set up your online presence either on Social Media or some other outlet. Be hella active.  Make friends in your space and with those who you would like to work with. What marketing strategies have been most effective for you?: Instagram is where most of my clientele come from. I would say pick ONE platform or strategy when you are first starting out… Going in 20 different directions at once will drain the hell out of you. Pick on direction, learn and master the hell out of it and scale your efforts from there. For you designers out there though, YOU NEED to be taking advantage of Instagram, the platform favors our type of work. Get in there and kill it if you aren’t already. How do you stay motivated or deal with fear or stress?: One way I deal with stress is working out. It does so much for me. It is like a cleanse of my physical tension and acts as an emotional flush. So, if you’re having an “ass” day… just change your environment, step outside, take a walk, lift some weights… or even go sit outside, and admire the scenery or things you’ve never noticed before, an appreciate those new sightings. How do you stand out from the competition? What do you to differentiate yourself from other people in your area of expertise?: I have multiple skill sets compared to my competition. I understand and utilize my design, conversion optimization, and understanding of traffic to “design businesses”. What are your top tips for people thinking of quitting a job to start a business?: In my personal opinion… DON’T QUIT your day job just yet! What I mean by that is, unless you have resources at your disposal to keep you afloat as you are building your business, don’t just kill a fuel source. That income is FUEL for your business. Use that income (fuel source) for advertising, buying resources to learn, software/VA to help take care of some of your tasks, etc. Building a business is stressful, and will 100% take longer than you think. It will be 100%+ more stressful if you ALSO have to worry about $$ in addition to your family if you have one. Having additional stress is NOT what you want for yourself when you need to be out of your emotions to make the proper business decisions. All I’m saying here is just know what resources you need to set yourself up for success. Always play rigged games, and set yourself up for the best outcome. What is you favorite book, blog, podcast or other resource and why?: I love the Youtube channel The Futur. It’s great for designers looking to make their own path and gives the steps to do so. What business tool or online software could you not live without? What makes it easy to run your business?: I could NOT live without Instagram. It is my #1 Lead generator as of now. What do you like most about running your own business?: I love how much I get to learn from the challenges that I am faced with every day. They help me grow leaps and bounds. What’s next for your business? What do you have planned for the next year, or what big goals are you tracking on?: This next year we will be seeing where in our processes we can save time in order to use that time to go out and chase even more of the clientele we are looking to work with. What else is important that we haven’t asked?: Don’t be afraid to feel “stupid”. We all look a little funny when we start something new. We just have to embrace that feeling and know in our heart that we will continue and that we WILL get better over time.   Ready to start building YOUR business?

    "body": "2018/03/23 - Sometimes our struggles are the best thing that happen to us. It doesn’t feel like it at the time, of course. At the time it feels on par with having your toenails ripped out one by one, but in the end… In the end, our mistakes help us realize what we will no longer tolerate. And then we get to start again, as many times as we need. Eighteen months ago I decided to start a coaching business. I made a plan, I built a website, I started promoting, and in a short while I got a few clients and I loved it. Then I had a new idea. And I kind of started working on that. While kind of doing the other stuff. And traveling full-time and living out of a suitcase… And I stopped doing the things that were working before, without realizing it. The clients that had been hiring me stopped showing up with regularity, and I started attracting clients that LOVED what I did, but NO, there was no way they felt they should pay for it… Creativity is a b!tch. : As ‘artists,’ we always assume we don’t make money because we’re not good at our craft, when the reality is that we’re simply selling to the wrong people, or we’re so unfocused no one knows what the f*ck we’re actually offering. Because when you’re full of ideas, and capable of executing so many of them, it’s hard to pick just one! So we try to do them all… but we don’t do any of them well, never finish anything &amp; forget we have to promote to be known. (Pro-tip: one post is not enough!) Before you know it, you’re a starving artist working 100 hours a week just to make rent, feel like you’re running a charity, or you wake up in a panic at 1am to look for jobs on LinkedIn because you clearly can. not. hack. it as a business owner. Not that I’ve experienced any of that (this week…) but, at some point we all face a turning point.  It’s time to either pull a Tim Gunn and make it work, or give up and go back to life in a cube. Personally, I did NOT come this far just to come this far so, it’s time to rethink &amp; rebuild. Business success comes from persistence, not perfection. Ya’ gotta get up &amp; back into the arena when you’re knocked down, and adjust your tactics until you win. That often means finding the intersection of what you do best &amp; what you WANT to do most, and rebooting your business for the client that lives there. That doesn’t mean you turn away paying clients if you enjoy working with them. It means no longer building a business around clients that aren’t willing to pay for your expertise. Stop running your business with your heart or your creative chakra, and find the clients you can help who also want to pay you for what you do. Learn from my mistakes &amp; get focused on the best clients for you. And if you’re a creative person who wants to make a lot of money doing what you love, maybe impacting the world &amp; feeling pretty happy while you do it, let’s talk about how I might be able to help you make the same mistakes I have.

    "title": "Thinking of Starting Your Own Business?",
    "body": "2018/03/19 - Here’s the REAL reason you’re stuck in a job you hate (&amp; what to do about it…): How long have you been thinking about starting your own business? I’m guessing, if you’re anything like me, you’ve toyed with the idea for years. Years!?! So often I meet people who think they’re not capable of starting a business - their skills aren’t good enough, their portfolio isn’t good enough, they’re not creative enough, not educated enough… but those are just stories they tell themselves. After talking to 100’s of people, I can tell you that your skills or experience have little to do with your success when it comes to entrepreneurship. Do you want to know the real reason you’re still stuck? It’s FEAR.  Fear disguised as perfectionism.  Fear disguised as self-doubt.  Fear disguised as depression or anxiety.  Fear disguised as laziness. Fear is real b*tch.  Did you know that your body has the same fear response to self-promotions as it does to a bus coming at you?! REALLY! Your brain doesn’t understand the difference between real danger (the bus) and perceived danger (the threat of rejection). That means you have the same PANIC response when you’re thinking of launching your business that you would if you were playing in traffic. So, naturally, you find ways to avoid taking the action that will get you out of your job.  You suddenly find yourself very, very busy and unable to prioritize yourself or your sidehustle You mysteriously fall sick just when you’re about to hit send on that email blast or publish your site You magically find a reason why your job is going to get better in 6 months and you should TOTALLY just stick it out (again) You realize the kitchen sink hasn’t been cleaned in ages and must be scrubbed RIGHT now, or you will die. Procrastination is a form of fear too. You’re not lazy, and you don’t lack self-control. You’re scared! So, how can you outsmart your brain and get unstuck? 1.  Tell yourself the whole story. If you can’t get yourself to publish your website, find out what you’re afraid of. Then ask yourself what would REALLY happen if you launched with a typo.  Would you actually die? Or would you just fix the typo? Take the fear out of the story you’re telling yourself. 2.  Create a sense of confidence.  See yourself actually succeeding instead of telling yourself you can’t, by creating a plan you’re confident in and by making small steps everyday. Feel confident in your ability to run your own business, and feel proud for taking action. Your mindset is the #1 factor in your business success. This is why we spend the first 4 weeks of our time together in Six Figure Freelancers on vision, planning and goals. We create a vision for your life that’s so powerful you’re actually inspired to move forward and take action. And we uncover some of those habits that have kept you from success in the past so you can outsmart your brain. Ready to stop finding excuses and start your own business?

And it’s been proven (by people a lot smarter than me) that remote workers are happier workers. If you’ve been considering leaving your job to enjoy a location-independent lifestyle, there are really two paths forward::  Start a business that will support your lifestyle Find a remote job that will support your lifestyleSeems like these days everyone wants to over complicate this “digital-nomad” thing and make it into a movement and a particular “skill” you need. “Digital Nomad” is not a job title, career or position. Truth is, a digital nomad is simply someone that has the ability to earn a living online and chooses to travel full-time instead of have a traditional home. There are no rules or requirement other than the gumption to pack your life into a suitcase and find a way to make it work. So if you’re thinking you’d like to try this life, and you’re not ready to start a business - DON’T. Some people are not meant to be in business for themselves, and that is OKAY. There is nothing wrong with you if you don’t want to start a business, and you do NOT have to be an entrepreneur to work remotely and enjoy the location-independent lifestyle.

    "title": "Adventures of a Digital Nomad: Dating",
    "body": "2018/02/22 - Last summer, I had the amazing opportunity to attend Date with Destiny with Tony Robbins in Gold Coast, Australia and it was one of the most transformative weeks of my life. In a week, I made some really good friends and basically required all my core values to better serve me. I left go of some really old programming around not being good enough and I spent a lot of time getting focused on what I actually want in my life. I came away from our week with a vision for my future that included some big tasks:  Growing my location independent business to 7-figures and becoming who I need to do that Prioritizing my health over all other things, excuses be damned and Entering into a loving, passionate healthy relationship with a man I adore. So far, I’m doing okay on the health** and business and have made about 0 progress on the life partner piece. When I left Remote Year, one of the reasons I went to London was that I needed some familiarity and had friends there. But another reason was that it seemed the easiest place to start dating and to settle into for a few months, as I was desperately craving stability. Boy was I wrong. Turns out, when you’ve created a life full of freedom, where you can travel and live where you want and work your own hours, it’s really hard to relate to someone living the typical work-home-tv-sleep-work routine so common in western society. Plus, it wasn’t as easy to settle in without a resident visa and I realized I’d really rather not spend winters in the UK… I mean, that was just kind of a dumb oversight on my part. Why would I go back to cold and rain when I can be anywhere? Duh. Anyway, from a dating perspective, I thought if I want to meet someone that’s living this crazy life of freedom, and avoid winter, maybe I’d be better off going where the nomads are. And I popped on over to Bali. Strike 2. At first I was pretty pleased to be there and I thought I’d settle in for 3–6 months. But life in Bali wore on me pretty quickly for a number of reason, including poor WiFi, lack of sidewalks and general difficulties getting around. I didn’t spend much time trying to date or even spending much time around other nomads, as the primary workspace in my area was shoulder to shoulder packed everyday. I made some incredible friends but ultimately didn’t enjoy living in Bali enough to stay, and I just didn’t have the energy to date. So, I decided I’d head for the Digital Nomad Epicenter: Chiang Mai, Thailand. Everyone is talked to had raved about it, and it’s got the highest concentration of nomads… In this game I’m playing of “Are You My City…” I though for sure CM would be a great place to grab an apartment and settle in for a few months. In hindsight, maybe I should have done some research. I’ve not been here long, so I’m sure I’m missing some of the magic… but from what I’ve seen, CM is kind of the Tulsa of Thailand. It’s a nice place, affordable to live, but not all that exciting. It’s just kind of there. There ARE a ton of amazing temples, the food is great and there are some good tourist attractions (primarily the elephant sanctuaries), but I’ve learned since I got here the primary reason that CM is so popular is simply the cost of living. And that is great — you can get a monthly apartment starting around $200 a month for a fleabag or a nice place for $4–700 — but basically CM has gotten its reputation as a nomad place simply because a lot of young nomads are too broke to live anywhere else. And after 15 months of non-stop travel, a temple is just another temple to me. I don’t mean that to be as douchy as I’m sure it sounds… but once you’ve seen a couple dozen giant gold Buddha’s it’s no longer the draw it was. I mean, I drove by three on my way to get coffee this morning. Temples are to Thailand what Walgreens are to America. On every corner. So, the search for a new city continues. The search for someone to share my life with continues. The business building continues. The soul searching and health prioritization continues. The exhaustion never effing stops. But I’ve stopped thinking too much about any of it. I get up every morning and do some meditation and writing, and then I prioritize some work and try to maybe go have some fun, or to relax in the hammock. This week I’ve been dogsitting and I have lots of canine love and I’m pretty busy with the launch of sixfigurefreelancers. com I’m at a weird cross-roads where I’m too burnout to keep traveling full time but I’m not ready to “go home” either (not that I really know where home is anymore. ). So, for now, I’m slowing down and I’m returning to the western world… but in Australia. I’m heading to Melbourne for 3 months at the end of January and really looking forward to having sidewalks again. Plus, I hear it’s a lot like Portland with more sun, fewer hipsters and Aussie accents. Maybe Melbourne will be my new city? **P. S. I’ve recently met an amazing naturopath that works online with frequent travelers.  Kirsten Swales specializes in digestion issues (and nearly every travel has them) but she’s seriously an amazing coach and resource.

    "body": "2018/02/06 - Well, 2017, you certainly weren’t what I expected but I couldn’t be more amazed at how we did this year. We may have missed our financial goals but we accomplished so much more than we ever anticipated when we left the US in January. While virtually nothing went as anticipated, we had a blast and life will never be the same.  We visited 15 countries and lived in nearly as many cities, and made 100’s of friends around the world, including an Emu named Emma and a Koala named Morton. We danced in Barcelona, did Yoga in India, wrote in Italy and road tripped in Australia. We met Orangutan’s and Proboscis monkeys in Borno and learned about Monitor Lizards from a tiny woman that spoke no English except to say “Madame” in Thailand.  We had some close calls, but came out on top in the end. There was the time we got bit by a dog in Malaysia and almost died in the jungle of Penang, and the subsequent treatment for rabies, or the time we got splashed in the face with sewage water and became so violently ill with that we decided to name our parasite Norbit. Then there was the date with Mr. “I Have No Empathy…,” that left us thankful to still have skin.  We went swimming in a couple dozen rooftop infinity pools (and even made out with a boy in one), shopped for seafood so fresh it was jumping out the bucket and snubbed an Ambassador during dinner to read our Kindle during a cruise through Ha Long Bay — one of the dozen or so UNESCO sites we visited.  We learned to live with less and to make the most of every day, and to appreciate things so much more. We witnessed poverty so extreme it can’t be described and we saw the effects of human evil in multiform. Walking through a high-school where more than 20,000 Cambodians were tortured and slaughtered made us a different person, as did seeing the fresh blood of the attack on Las Ramblas.  We witnessed a half dozen hindu, buddhist and muslim holy celebrations and learned that people are more or less the same, no matter where you go or what they look like. We all want to love &amp; be loved, we all want to be safe and happy. We learned the power and language of laughter when we peed on a trash heap on the side of the road with a half-dozen Cambodian women which resulted in an hour long giggle fit for our tour bus.  We got covered in grease paint by some of the cutest kids in the world, and donated money to a woman pushing around a stroller full of kittens in dresses in the name of charity. We saw cats and goats on leashes, and got to pet kangaroos. We rode our first motorcycle and drove on the left.  We changed our life at Date with Destiny and danced our asses off at Business Mastery. We saw the great barrier reef from a seaplane and chastised a cockatoo like it was a dog when it stole our Pringles can. We ate gelato &amp; pizza under the Tuscan Sun, stumbled into dozens of amazing temple and cathedrals, and got stuck in an elevator in Utrecht .  We crashed our bicycle into a rice paddy and had to be pulled out, and we quit Remote Year. We smelled durian for the first time (which can best be described as a cross between rotten bananas and warm dirty diapers), and ate fried scorpions and multiple meats on sticks. We posed with 1000’s of statue’s and did a couple 1,000 other things.  2017, you weren’t exactly what I wanted, but you were exactly what I needed. We learned to love ourselves this year, to savor every moment, follow our heart and our gut and to trust that everything is going to work out.  The conversations we’ve had, the things we’ve witnessed, the stories we’ve gathered are priceless and we wouldn’t change a thing. Except maybe the sewage thing. Or the rabbies thing… but really? Those stories are going to be the best to share in the years to come.  Now it’s time to put you to bed in anticipation of an amazing 2018. With Love &amp; Light, P. S.

    "body": "2018/01/19 - When I was in Bali, I passed by a hostel with a sign hanging out front that said:  Clean Rooms Hot Showers Good VibesIt made me really really happy because vibes, or energy is something I’ve been thinking about a lot. Like how you can get a feel for a city right away. I’m sitting in a Hong Kong coffee shop and I’ve been in town less than 12 hours and I’m already thinking, “Yeah, I could totally live here. ” (In case you forgot, I’m playing the worlds most interesting game of “Are you my city” so this is always a thought, anywhere) . I mean, I’m sure once I looked at the cost of living I’d have second thoughts… but the vibe though. I believe cities, like people, carry their own energy. I knew immediately when i got to Lisbon that I didn’t love the energy. It just felt… off. Not bad, per se, just sort of… hollow? Conversely, when I landed in Barcelona, it was like I could feel the entire city pulsing through my body. It was like walking into a dance club, except I didn’t see any Uggs and I didn’t hear Kei$ha playing. But it was still just a liquid, sexy, hot, vibrant, energy. Chiang Mai? Retirement community with a college. Nice. Calm (ish). A little bland. Comfortable. Hong Kong. Energetic + Dramatic, a little chaotic, but also strangely mellow - or maybe I’ve been in Asia so long I don’t know the meaning of the word. :) Anyway, I’ve been learning &amp; thinking a lot about energy this year:  Masculine &amp; Feminine energy Money energy Physical energy Locational energyOur lives can really go pear-shaped when any of these energies are out of whack. And it’s so easy to get out of whack. I spent the bulk of 2017 out-of-alignment. Swinging back and forth between “Good Vibes Only” and “watch out for the black cloud of doom. ” As such I’ve dubbed 2018 as my year of “RE. ”  Rebuilding Recentering Reparenting RelaxingMy aim is to learn how to consistently do less to have more, and enjoy my life even more… without having to check “relax” off of my to-do list. If you’re a chronic over-achiever, you’ll know what I mean. And if you’re not, will you teach me how to chill? I’ve known for a long-time that I “became” an achiever to please the men in a childhood. Particularly my emotionally abusive stepfather who told me on a near daily daily basis how stupid, fat and lazy I was.  We always have a choice in how we choose to interpret and respond to what people tell us.   I could have accepted what he said as truth, and settled into a life of mediocrity and worthless victimhood. I chose to put two middle fingers high in the air and PROVE how smart and driven and worthy I am. It’s no wonder I drank so much in my 20’s - it was one of the ways I could turn off the obsessive need to complete something. But after more than 30 years of constant DOING in order to feel okay, I’m exhausted. So I’m course correcting and learning how to relax and let things happen. To “Let Go &amp; Let God,” and stick around and “wait for the miracles to happen”. And they always do. Maybe not as quickly as my impatient self would like, but I’ve spent enough years focused on what I HAD to do. It’s time to focus on what I GET* to do. Which, right now is work with incredible people and create incredible programs while travel the world. This week when I’m not working, I get to explore Hong Kong a little and I might even go to Disneyland HK this weekend - because, Holy Crap, that’s a thing. How about you? Are you getting to do what you want to do enough? Or are you still doing what you have to do? If not, you might try shifting your focus - I suggest starting your day with gratitude.

Subscribing to email lists, signing up for webinars, grabbing all the email freebies, following the hell out of everyone on social media with a shiny download… And sure enough, in short time I became so overloaded and confused that I became completely ineffective. Not to mention fricking terrified of opening my email. And I’m typically a bit of an email Nazi - I spend a fair amount of time setting up systems to keep things out of my inbox. I know if I’m feeling this overwhelmed, some of you out there (who’re perhaps a little less anal-retentive than yours truly), must be losing your damn minds. Because we are just so inundated with ads + sales + valuable information + for me, its just ALL. TOO. MUCH. I actually found myself thinking about quitting my coaching business last week (yes, again) - not because I don’t love it or see a future in it, but because I got so fricking overloaded with the all the things I “should” be doing and feeling like I’m clearly a sh*tty marketer because I’m not making 100-million-dollars on every launch like all the other coaches do. And also simultaneously knowing that so many of these “coaches” are completely full of crap and super-shady in their tactics (or at least less than transparent) and feeling like I have to be a complete asshat on social media to get any traction. You know the folks I’m talking about, right? There’s the “Humble Bragger” who just can’t believe what an amazing week she had when 47 of her 1-on-1 clients made 7-figures, or the blatant “here’s the Lamborghini I bought with my pocket money” braggarts, or the “if you just download this PDF your life’ll never be the same + you’ll crap rainbows for eternity” jack-wagon. [caption id=”attachment_28361” align=”aligncenter” width=”1024”] I urge you to think of this picture every time someone wants you to grab their freebie. You’re Welcome. Photo by Taylor Bryant on Unsplash[/caption] Photo by Taylor Bryant on Unsplash I’m so fricking over it, and I know you are too. So I’m going to be making adjustments to  how I interact with information personally, as well as my business practices. I would encourage you to do the same, especially if you are currently feeling overwhelmed about what to do next to move your business forward. For one thing, I’m aiming to simplify my own marketing and to be authentic as f*ck. Find one or two online marketing tactics to generate traffic and increase sales then ignore everything else. Personally, I prefer to write long form versus spend my time on social media, so I’m challenging myself to write at least a blog post a week and to spend a fair amount of time trying to simplify complex concepts in print &amp; video training. I encourage you to STOP listening to everyone with a message and to hand-pick the content you consume. If you don’t get value from email lists, unsubscribe. : (Yes, even mine! I’m even happy to recommend other coaches or programs that’ll work for you - #communityovercompetition) If you get value but get overloaded, filter them out of your inbox and save them up for a binge. But do yourself a favor and start clearing the overwhelm out of your life. You’ll feel so much better and your business will thank you for it. I’ve listed more tips on productivity and business success over here. [/et_pb_text][/et_pb_column][/et_pb_row][/et_pb_section] "

    "title": "5 Ways to Increase Productivity & Reduce Overwhelm",
    "body": "2018/01/17 - I had an epiphany recently and decided I needed to detox from external input. I turned off my notifications, deleted the Facebook app from my phone &amp; started dumping emails into the trash. It was one of the best weeks of my life. See, at some point in the last 6-months I stopped taking my own advice &amp; started overloading on input. Subscribing to email lists, signing up for webinars, grabbing all the email freebies, following the hell out of everyone on social media with a shiny download… And sure enough, in short time I became so overloaded and confused that I became completely ineffective. Not to mention fricking terrified of opening my email. And I’m typically a bit of an email Nazi - I spend a fair amount of time setting up systems to keep things out of my inbox. So, if I’m feeling this overwhelmed, I know some of you out there are totally hosed. Here are five things you can do TODAY to reduce digital overload:: 1. Unsubscribe like a crazy person, or get an app to do it for you:: I’ve gotten better at actually unsubscribing to lists, but it can be tedious. I use Unroll. me to add random stuff (mostly purely sales stuff like Groupon alerts or Creative Market deals) to a daily email “rollup email” or to bulk unsubscribe. I’ve also heard amazing things about Sane Box but I’ve never used it personally. 2. Use Gmail Filters to Organize Your Emails: I’m a bit of a nerd, and I love to learn so some lists I don’t want to unsubscribe to - but I also don’t want to get 45,000 emails a day in my inbox. How do you live like that!? So I set up filters to automatically tag, sort and move emails out of my inbox so I can go in and binge read them later. This method works better if you don’t have the “promotions” tab enabled in gmail. 3. Turn off notifications on your phone: When I was housesitting in Thailand, the homeowner left his phone at the house. But he didn’t turn off his ringer and the damn thing pinged 28 times a day when he got an email. I don’t know how you live like this either. Unless you are a doctor on-call, or a PR assistant that MUST be notified immediately, turn those noises and popups off. It’ll take you a bit of manual labor but its worth it. Go into your settings and spend 20 minutes turning off any unnecessary notifications. You can also… 4. Install the freedom app: Visit http://freedom. to to grab the app and install it and you can lock yourself out of social media (or other time suck sites). Unfortunately, the iPhone app wasn’t working properly with Facebook recently due to an API update, but if you uninstall the FB app from your phone (life changing), it’s a great way to get some uninterrupted time. Speaking of Facebook… 5. Add friends to lists on Facebook, and Unfollow with abandon: You know you don’t have to see all those updates that your great Aunt Hilda posts about her bunions and bunt cakes, right? Just click that little wheel on the top right of any of her posts and select “unfollow Hilda” to get a little relief. And, if you’re like me, you may have noticed that it’s nearly impossible to see anything your actual friends are doing on Facebook anymore because you’re connected to everyone and see 1400 ads a day… One hack is to add friends to a Facebook list - I have one called “Close Friends” and I periodically peek in to see what’s really important in my peeps lives. The caveat? You’ve got to visit everyone’s profile like an old fashioned stalker to even have the option. Total pain in the arse, but again, your sanity is worth it. So, a few parting words… For best results, I recommend hand selecting a half-dozen strangers you trust to really follow and kick everyone else the f*ck out of your inbox and your feeds. Your sanity will thank me later. Because even if you only subscribe to lists from people who’re WAY smarter than you, if you try to do what ALL of them say, you’ll end up overwhelmed and confused and probably paralyzed from moving forward with your business, because GAWD FORBID YOU MAKE THE WRONG MOVE. Case in point… I actually found myself thinking about quitting my coaching business awhile ago because I got so fricking overloaded with the all the things I “should” be doing to make sales and feeling like I’m clearly a sh*tty marketer because I’m not making 100-million-dollars on every launch like all the other coaches do. I’d signed up for approximately 18,000 email lists that would get me the 28-figure launch I wanted but alas, I was too paralyzed to do anything. So when I saw Matthew Kimberley’s Single Malt Mastermind I joined immediately. Matthew’s sales page just rang so true for me in terms of how much work and how much distraction comes with so many coaching programs these days. If you need help with sales, you should totally join Matthew’s program. Want more tips on overcoming overwhelm? Grab my Ebook today to get started. ** Header photo by Carl Heyerdahl on Unsplash   "

    "body": "2018/01/10 -  Pay yourself first, always. Founders that bootstrap are far more likely to struggle, suffer from burnout and quit when things get hard. Pay yourself first, and pay yourself well, if you want to go the distance.  Hire fast. Fire Faster A good hire can accelerate your growth - even a personal assistant can make the difference between burnout and brilliant. But a bad employee can destroy moral at a startup faster than anything else, and kill your progress.  Know your why AND you company’s why Your personal ‘why’ is going to shape all the decision you make at the beginning of your company’s growth, and help you determine what steps to take first. Your company why will act as the north star for all your employees and will ensure that your customers needs are always considered first.  Focus on you Zone of Genius Chances are, you have some natural talents that are going to help you shine as a leader. And you’ve also got some “areas of improvement. ” But just because you’re the boss doesn’t mean you have to do it all. Focus more time doing what you enjoy &amp; outsource the rest so you’re at your best.  Fail Often, Fail Quickly It’s okay to fail, but do it quickly - forgive yourself, learn from it and move on. Constant and never-ending improvement is the key to lean methodology, and when you work with me I’ll challenge you to consistently launch before you’re ready, make faster decisions and learn to trust your instincts.  Bonus Tip (but probably the most important): Have fun!

    "title": "How to Start a Business Without Going Broke",
    "body": "2018/01/10 - If you’re thinking of leaving your corporate job to start consulting, chances are you’re more than a smidge concerned that you might end up broke or overworked - especially if you’re getting started as a freelancer. As someone who quit a “dream job” without a plan back in 2008 and did just that, I’m glad you’re here so I can give you some business tips for starting a business that isn’t going to crush your spirit and WILL replace your income. The first and most important thing you need to do is to get it into your head that you are starting a business and NOT going to be hunting for jobs. There is a subtle mental switch here that you need to make to ensure you’re always focused on growing your business for the long haul, rather than taking easy gigs. There’s a time and place for easy gigs and Upworking, but if you’re not careful you’ll fall into the trap so many new freelancers make in that you end up spending so much time in your business (upworking) that you fail to work ON your business and really develop a brand and build relationships. Once you’ve made the leap into the mindset of a business owner, you can start working smarter. There are some core components of building a profitable business from the ground up: Set a clear vision for the company you want to create. Big or small? Solo or team? Where will you work and how many hours? What will you make. You want to really think about what you want for the long term and WHY you’re building this business for you. Once you have your long term vision, look at your first year. Pretend you’ve just had the perfect year of business and everything went exactly as planned. What did it look like? Where did you find your first client? What type of projects did you do? Use these as starting points for setting SMART goals for your business, and then draft a “30-minute businesses plan” for making it happen. You’ve got a vision, you’ve got a plan, now it’s time to execute. The next thing you need is to get clear on your client and what you can do for them better than anyone else. I highly suggest creating packages and offering solutions - not just selling “graphic design services” or “copywriting. ” What can you bundle? What problems does your work solve? Talk in benefits for your clients Now you’ve got something to offer, it’s time to start connecting and building relationships. This is where a lot of new consultants struggle - they worry that because they haven’t run a business before what they have to offer isn’t good enough. But if you can solve a problem, you can create value. So you’ve got to learn the art of self-promotion and talking to people. You can get your first client before you have a website or anything fancy just by talking to people and asking for referrals. Once you’re ready to really build a business you’ll want to create a marketing system that’s going to generate leads for you. A website is the most obvious component, and some form of social media. I tell my clients to focus on one to two platforms that they enjoy and where they can connect with their clients. Don’t try to stretch yourself by being on every social platform if that’s not your thing. Create value online and offline and share it with people who need your service. Finally, continue to build relationships after you’ve done the work. Support you clients after the job is done, help them promote their business and ask them to reciprocate. Be an advocate for your clients and they’ll advocate for you. And if you create raving fans, they’ll refer more business your way To sum up, if you want to start a business, AND make money, you’ll need to focus on a few critical areas:  Creating a vision, business plan and goals to measure against Building a business instead of hunting for jobs Learning how to sell &amp; market yourself as a freelancer generate leads and get freelance clients Practice having conversations, making offers and converting leads into freelance clients Doing awesome work that solves problems or serves a client need (and knowing what that’s worth to your client) Following up and asking for testimonials, referrals and repeat businessMost freelancers who struggle do so because they don’t know how to market themselves as solutions or generate leads - instead, they rely on “marketplace” sites to get client work. This is a good fix for picking up occasional work on the side, but not a good long term strategy if you want to build a thriving, profitable freelance business. Focus on creating your own brand and marketing your solutions as a freelancer - NOT selling your skills. Want help? Grab the Book for Step-by-Step Advice.  "

    "title": "How to Create a Killer Portfolio Website",
    "body": "2017/12/22 - Website Must-Haves I once did a competition where I opened my calendar and took calls from 15 creative freelancers. Many were incredibly talented writers &amp; designers failing to make good money, even though there is so much work out there right now for talented people! Inevitably, I looked at their portfolio websites &amp; social media profiles and could tell why they weren’t getting work. These individuals were great artists, but their websites were such a mess that people would just bounce once they arrived. Their “portfolios” were doing a disservice to their great work - usually because they fail to say what it is that they actually do with any clarity or completely lack personality or professionalism - leaving it up to the reader to figure out how to hire them and what for. Just a few tweaks could take a bad website to good, and a good one to killer. And you NEED a killer website. Here are the top must-haves for any freelancer or creative’s website:  A clear headline and call-to-action above the fold. You have three seconds to capture someone’s attention with your website. Within three seconds of someone landing on the page, you want them to know your value. You want to share what it is that you do, and for who, in the first frame of your site before any scrolling. This will keep relevant visitors hooked, and get them looking deeper. Include clear call-to-action that is easy, and dumb-simple. Something like “Click here to schedule a call,” that will leave your visitor with no questions about what happens next Mobile &amp; speed optimization. You need to be able to load your site, read it, interact with it on a mobile device, and it needs to load quickly across all devices, no excuses. If I can’t load your website quickly on your desktop and smartphone, you’re losing business.  Design with your audience in mind. You’ve done the research and you know what your audience is like. You’re aware of their interests, their needs, and their habits. Design to these! If your audience is mostly feminine women looking to deepen their coding skills, don’t design a site that might not appeal to them. Keep your design light, and your language clear. Design something that you know they’ll enjoy seeing.  Good branding. This doesn’t mean dropping thousands on an identity package, but it does mean taking time to think about how your brand comes across on all online platforms. Branding includes messaging and personality, so be consistent in what you call your company and your services and how you use social media. Visually, good branding can be as simple as having an easy-to-read logo, sticking to two to three brand colors and using the same number of fonts (max). Keep it simple, include plenty of whitespace, and just keep improving as you go.  A blog with a variety of content. At the beginning you probably won’t have this, but that can’t be an excuse not to launch. Write three to five solid blog posts to get yourself started, and just build from there. This will help you with SEO, as well as building credibility.  Personality! A website is absolutely a sales tool, and one of the most important to have in your arsenal. But that doesn’t mean it should be all about sales. Make it about yourself, your value, and the services you provide. Don’t be afraid to show your personality, so that visitors know a bit about the person behind the screen.  Credibility &amp; Expertise This goes along with a good brand, but you’ll want to use all the tricks you can to add credibility. Have you worked for some amazing companies before? Put their logos on your home page! Do you have stunning recommendations on LinkedIn? Add testimonials tooting your own horn. Have articles published in major publications? Add that press to your site. The more credibility and expertise you exude, the more likely someone is to want to work with you. Five steps to get you started:  Register a domain. Pick your URL and you can use a variety of online tools to see if it’s available. Different domain registrars have different benefits, so see what works best for you Get yourself a logo. You can create it yourself if you’re a designer, but make sure to keep it simple! You can also use 99designs or a similar platform to crowdsource a design on the cheap Find a webhost. Siteground is what I use for Wordpress hosting, and I’m super happy with them. Divi by Elegant themes is a great template builder (what this blog is built with). If you’re less technical, you might consider Squarespace, Weebly, Wix or even Lead Pages.  Write your content. You don’t need too much here, just five basic sections: Home, About, Services, Blog and Contact. Just those sections and you have functional content that could bring you business. Note: It’s better to have a single page with all of these sections on it than making me click through each! If you need help doing any of the above, hire someone! You can use Upwork, Fivvvr, ClickUp, 99designs, and many moreYou can get a basic site up and running in about a day, trust me. Just stay focused, keep it simple and you’ll be well on your way.

    "title": "Want to Grow Your Business to 6-Figures? Elevate Your Network!",
    "body": "2017/12/04 - I’d like you to think about the people you spend the majority of your time with. Are they supportive? Constructive? Do they engage you in great conversation? Do they encourage you to grow and go after the things you want in your life? Or are they holding you back by making you question your dreams? Are you keeping yourself small so you don’t make someone else feel bad? When it comes down to it, you are the aggregate of the five people you spend the most time with, so those people really matter. As an aspiring or new business owner, you need to cultivate this group well. If you are surrounded by people who aren’t also interested in expanding themselves, your business will suffer, too! I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how to grow a good network, and these are some things I’ve learned along the way.  Attend high-level professional and networking events.  The higher the quality of the events you’re going to, the higher the quality of your network. By finding events that are really focused on professional networking, you know that you’re in rooms with people who care about growth in the same way you do. These are people you can learn from and collaborate with, and they’ll inspire great ideas you wouldn’t have had otherwise.  Use meetup. com to find local events related to your industry.  Online forums and networks are great resources, but it’s also important to cultivate a local network. I use meetup. com to meet people locally who are on the same wavelength, and when I travel, too. When I moved to Barcelona, I went on a day trip with a women’s networking group. Through that, I made two business contacts, one who may turn into a client and one who’s referred me clients.  Find professional conferences in (and related to) your industry.  When I first started freelancing back in Portland over a decade ago, I started attending local professional events. Often they weren’t directly related to my work, but they always gave me new ideas. If you’re a marketer, maybe you could find useful information and contacts at an American Institute of Graphic Arts event. Or if you’re a designer, maybe American Marketing Association events could help you find new clients. Stepping outside of your zone of expertise exposes you to fresh new ideas, and this is a great way to do that.  Join Facebook groups.  It feels strange to say this, since I’m not a big fan of Facebook when it comes to professional stuff. That said, many Facebook groups are a great way to get in touch with people who you might not otherwise meet. Search for groups related to your profession, interests, and hobbies, and see what is out there. You might be surprised what you find! Seek out Linkedin groups.  Compared to Facebook groups, these are inherently more professional and focused on building out your network, but they do tend to be smaller. See if you can use these to identify interesting business contacts that you can follow up with individually.  Join a Mastermind group if you’re ready to invest more significant amounts of time or money. A Mastermind is a group of people that come together to elevate each other’s network and business. It’s usually higher-end, and a lot of coaches operate Masterminds that charge a small fortune. You can find cheaper ones, or even create your own! You just need to come up with some rules and ideas – look around online for guides – and then set regular meetings (in-person or virtual). It’s especially interesting when groups bring together people from different industries for some cross-pollination of ideas.  **Hire a coach (or join a group coaching program) **If you’re not sure where to grow next and want someone who’s gotten where you want to be, hire a business coach! Not only do you access your coaches knowledge, but oftentimes you’ll get access to your coaches network if you join a group program or online course. You coach can probably also recommend ways to grow your network you haven’t thought of yet. Ultimately, the goal of growing your network is to push yourself outside of your comfort zone, create higher quality contacts, and create a supportive network (especially if you’re new to consulting, or your existing networks don’t understand your decisions) where you can go when you are tired, overwhelmed or stuck. If entrepreneurship was easy, everyone would do it… the truth is, you’re going to have days where you question why you started working for yourself. You’ll have programs or calls or projects that don’t go well and you’ll not be able to figure out why, and you’ll want to rip your hair out. It’s on days like that when you NEED a supportive friend who get’s it – not your mom or bestie from high school who’s going to tell you to get a real job. If you don’t have the right support system, it’s unlikely you’ll be successful because you’ll give up. Don’t quit before the miracle happens. Start elevating your network now.

    "title": "Top 10 Freelance Portfolio Website Mistakes",
    "body": "2017/11/22 - Today, there is no question whether or not you should have a website for your freelance business. Having a good one is absolutely essential, but can be tricky for budding freelancers or creatives as creating a “portfolio” for getting a job can be totally ineffective for selling yourself as a freelance service provider. You don’t need a freelance portfolio - you need a website that sells. When you’re creating a website for your freelance business, remember that the “portfolio” you created in college is not going to cut it. A portfolio website showcases your skills and talents, and is usually used to get a job… If you want to run a successful, profitable, freelance business, you need to act like you are a business - not embark on an extended job hunt! Over the past ten years, as a hiring manager, a UX designer and a business coach for creatives, I’ve seen these mistakes over and over and over again, even though they’re pretty easy to avoid!  1 - Creating an art piece that is all about you and your “style”: A website should look nice, but it’s for your business - your website should clearly convey your message, communicate your brand message and sell your services. Your website should not be an art piece. Let me repeat…YOUR WEBSITE IS NOT ART. Your website should be a sales piece. Creative people often fall into a trap where they build a site that doesn’t sell them or make it clear what the visitor should do. I mean, what services do you actually offer? Or packages? What type of clients do you work with? It’s not enough anymore to call yourself a “freelance designer” or a “freelance copywriter” and expect people to hire you. As a freelancer you’re competing with digital agencies and collectives on-top of other freelancers - and if you’re not selling yourself, you’re not going to make the sale! 2 - Not creating an easy way for somebody to contact you: It’s officially time to leave witness protection when you begin freelancing. You’ve got to make it really easy for clients to find you and contact you. I don’t know how many artists’ websites I’ve looked at with no way to contact them. It’s wild! No matter what you do, don’t forget to add a contact form or link on your site. I suggest using Calendly so that people can immediately schedule a consultation with you in just a few clicks. 3 - Not including a call to action, or just having a really vague one: At least half of the portfolios I see don’t have any call to action at all, and another 40% are vague CTA’s like “hire me. ” Hire you for what!? If you don’t clarify what you offer and make it appealing to your ideal client, you’re losing business. You can’t expect someone to want to “Click Here” when they don’t know where the click takes them. You want to be as clear as possible with your call to action, so that people want to follow through. Try “Click Here to Book a Free Consultation” or “Click Here to Request a Free Website Review” instead of “click here” 4 - Failing to talk about results: Your website is one place where you can brag about the things you’ve done well in your career, the work you’ve done, and the results you’ve gotten. If you’re not talking about your results, visitors won’t care how beautiful your website is. Make sure to take some time to show off a bit, talking about SPECIFIC results you’ve gotten (and use $$$ + ### whenever you can) and you’ll turn visitors into customers. 5 - Talking about the tasks that you’ve done instead of selling your services: I see a lot of laundry lists on websites: “I do logos, copy writing, editing, marketing, and more. ” I don’t know what that means! It’s so vague. Don’t be this vague! As a visitor to your site - and potential client - I want to to know what kind of package you can sell me! Maybe you can offer a logo and a website, a full website of copy or end-to-end event management. Offer a package, and make it easy to understand using your clients language - don’t make your audience do the work connecting the dots on what they can get from working with you. 6 - Not having any personality. : People connect with people, not with websites!! Stop hiding your personality or creating copy that’d be at home in a 50’s “how-to use a typewriter” manual. If I’m going to hire an event planner who will be running my event and working with me, I want to know who they are (in addition to the results they will bring me). A few years ago, I was offered a job interview because my resume showed some personality and said that I liked fish tacos! I wasn’t just another generic cover letter; I talked to them like I was human. Be someone your customer wants to work with. 7 - Not having an opt-in opportunity: No matter what business you are in, you want to be planning for future expansion and growth, and should be planning to add passive income to your business. Whether that’s through coaching, affiliate revenue, blogging, creating a course or selling a product, you need a way to communicate with people. Email is one of the most reliable methods, as you own your list (vs. etc), &amp; it’s read more thoroughly than social posts. A lot of people try to create mailing lists by using something generic like “Sign up for my newsletter. ” This rarely works. (No one wants another newsletter!) Instead, offer something of value (an ebook, premium content, a discount, a consultation, a free audit). Treat this as another opportunity to show your customers that you care about them and understand their needs. But make sure you’re saving those email addresses in a CRM or email marketing program (I’ve got some of my faves listed here). 8 - Not being mobile optimized: Nearly 80% of the world will probably view your site on mobile. I know that it can sometimes be a pain in the ass to optimize for mobile, but it’s incredibly important. Make sure that any pop-ups don’t obscure the whole screen, that you can see text nicely, that images re-size. And remember, once is not enough. This is something you should check in on as often as you can! Even I, with years of experience designing web products, have fallen prey to this one. Build in time to regularly preform an audit on your site for mobile updates, as well as general maintenance. 9 - Failing to optimize for speed: You get three seconds to capture the attention of the average web user. If your site takes two seconds to load, you’ve already lost most visitors. Make sure to do everything you can to minimize this load time. Check out Google’s PageSpeed Insights, and look around for ways to improve your performance. If you’re not technical, hire someone to help you out. Showing that you have - or care about - technical proficiency is proof to your client that you know what you’re doing - particularly if you’re a designer or online marketer. 10 - The worst of them all: never launching your website at all: Yes, it’s scary. It’s time-consuming. It can be confusing and overwhelming. But there’s no reason not to do it. And yes, you’d be amazed the number of people that I talk to that start a conversation with me about not getting any clients and when I ask them about their website they say haven’t gotten around to it. Ummm…. By never launching your site, you’re missing out on so many opportunities for yourself and your business. If you don’t know where to start, just keep it simple and move on from there. You NEED a website. Even if it’s just a well written About. Me page. No matter what you do, I suggest you adopt a “testing” mindset. Launch quickly, iterate always. Your goal should not be perfection, just constant and never-ending improvement. Do you have a portfolio or website that’s not performing for you? Do you feel like your marketing programs are disappearing into the void? Are you relying on Upwork or other low-paying Freelancer sites to bring in business? Or are you still stuck in a cubicle trying to build a “sidehustle” and wondering why no one is contacting you? You’re most likely still thinking like an employee and not a business. Want more? Check out my top tips here. "

    "title": "How to Start a Freelance Business You Can Run Anywhere",
    "body": "2017/11/22 - Are you thinking of starting a freelance or consulting business that’ll allow you to #workanywhere? I’d like to tell you a story that might save you years of pain and tons of money. I quit my first “dream job” in 2008 after becoming desperately burnt out. My life &amp; health were in dire straits and I knew I had to do something different. Anything different, actually. While I attended graduate school, I struggled to make a living as a freelance designer - so much so that I ended up taking a job I knew I would hate, just to pay the bills. I repeated this process multiple times over the next couple of years. I’d get inspired to start my business, I’d get some fun projects, then I’d struggle. I’d promote myself like mad and exhaust myself looking for clients, then inevitably take on another full-time role that left me feeling like a failure (no matter how fantastic a career choice it was or the company was). Then I started to shift my mindset and began to learn from people who had done what I wanted to do - built a profitable freelance business that didn’t steal all their time. In 2016, I quit my last “day job,” spent 8-hours creating a website, updating my social profiles, sending out a couple of emails and never looked back.  I booked my first $20k consulting package within a matter of weeks. I know you may be thinking you could never do that… other people can, but it’ll never happen for me. Why not!? If I can, why not you? I am not more deserving or special than you! In fact, I’m not even the best designer out there - but I do some things differently than the traditional “freelancer. ” Many times we think we know how to get to a certain level in business by simply applying the same strategies we’ve applied before and doubling our efforts. While this game plan might work sometimes, it’s hard to sustain and will feel sporadic based on our stamina or our schedule. You see, it’s not about exhausting ourselves with repetition. It’s about shifting our perspective to radically change the way we’re working in the first place. If you’ve not started your business or haven’t hit six-figures as a freelancer you NEED to shift your strategy and your mindset.  There are FIVE critical areas in your business that need attention and when you discover what those are, it’ll change your life and leave you with peace of mind. I spent close to 10-years and $75,000 personally figuring out how to build a six-figure freelance business, and I’d love to help you skip the “groundhog day” cycle. If you want my 6-Figure Freelance Formula, access my free training videos here. Chances are, you’re reading this because you desperately want to leave the corporate world but don’t know where to start. Or, you’ve already left your job but you’ve have found you’re not able to keep the same lifestyle (they call it golden handcuffs for a reason). This is probably because you’re not thinking like an entrepreneur - you’ve still got an employee mindset! I mean, do you have an actual game plan for hitting six-figures? Or even landing a $10k project and replicating that? Or are you just putting your name out there and hoping business comes your way like most struggling freelancers do? Here’s why you need to start building a brand: If your cubicle or corner office is feeling more like a prison, and you’re ready to start your own business, join me for this free training. I’ll help you determine if starting a business is right for you, walk you through the high-level strategy for getting started and give you 3 critical components you need for growing your business to 6-figures. You can grab the FREE TRAINING here. Or, if you’d rather read, you can  jump right in and get my book, “Secrets of a Six Figure Freelancer,” your complete guide to starting a consulting business from home. I’ll walk you step-by-step through starting your new business.  "

    "title": "10 (Unexpected) Business Tips from Tony Robbins",
    "body": "2017/11/17 - Tony Robbins is the best teacher I’ve ever learned from, and the lessons he taught me are valuable for nearly everyone I work with. If you’re a creative or spiritual person like myself, you might not feel like Tony Robbins events would work for you - I certainly thought of TR as synonymous with informercials and sales and masculinity. But after watching I Am Not Your Guru on Netflix, my opinion changed completely and I knew I had to experience an event with myself. After walking on fire at Unleash The Power Within I was hooked and drank all the coolaid, including signing up for Tony’s Mastery programs. Here are my top 10 takeaways from Tony Robbin’s Business Mastery:  Fall in love with your clients, not your products or services. This is huge. Most companies focus on the things that they offer, what they do, their key value/differentiators. What is actually important is who your client is, what will keep them happy, how to get them to come back.  Get your finances in order, and keep two sets of books A lot of consultants or freelancers fail at this, and I definitely have in the past. We wait a long time to separate our business and personal expenses, and rarely have bookkeepers. As we grow - especially if we want to do sustainably - we must look at our finances. This means two sets of books (one for the IRS and one for the actual business) and a lot of attention to detail. Your personal books should clearly separate out any “tax deduction” purchases (like that new camera) that weren’t absolutely critical to business operations - this way, you know how healthy your business actually is.  The most important part of your business is creating a raving fanbase. You want customers who will tell their friends, put you on social media, and spread the word about how awesome it is to work with you. This will keep you sustainable and growing, which is important in a world that faces recessions every 8-10 years! This kind of reliable and excited set of customers will help you weather any winter. And it’s just fun! You’re happy when you are making them happy.  Always add more value for your client. Whether that’s creating packages that serve their needs or creating tailored programs, or surprising and delighting, it means serving them to your absolute best ability and going above and beyond. Make sure you’re doing more more than what your competitors will do. Offer yourself in the service of whatever it is they need, give your best content away for free! This is what will create the raving fan culture.  Be Netflix, Not Blockbuster (stay ahead of the competition) When building your offerings, you don’t want to react to what competitors are doing, you want to stay ahead of them. This will take research and thought, but when you know your client better than anyone else, you can also offer them services that no one else is offering. Great companies that think ahead of the competition have happier customers, change industries, and come out ahead. (Think Amazon versus Borders, or Netflix versus Blockbuster. ) You must have a second biz (especially true if you’re a service based business, like a freelancer or consultant) If there’s a global meltdown and all of a sudden no one wants to or can pay for your services, you need a back-up. This might be evergreen content and online courses, or real estate and investments. This is good practice and it brings you one step closer to being an owner, not an operator, which brings us to… You want to stop trading time for money. If you’re starting off as a freelance designer or writer, you’re trading your time for your money, and that’s okay! Eventually, you will want to create packages based on value, instead of time. As you do this - and incorporate alternate sources of income - you’ll become an operator with more time and income on your hands.  Master the funnel and keep it narrow. Often, people decide to start a business by going after any client they can get. That’s totally understandable, but it’s not the best way to go about building your business. Instead, you want to really focus on one client type or industry. You’ll be able to speak to that person’s needs better when you’re focused. That will mean you produce better work and keep clients happier! Make business a spiritual game (my personal favorite) Business inherently exist to make money, this is true. But that doesn’t mean you can’t love your clients and help customers thrive! I think about the work I do as showing up to serve, not by focusing on my bottom line. Ask yourself: “What can I do to create value? How can I help someone do something they’ve never done before?” Manage your personal state carefully. As entrepreneurs, we often struggle to take good care of ourselves. We might focus really hard on projects ahead of us, skip lunch, and put work ahead of well-being. We might also neglect to think about the ways we work best for various tasks. Maybe we write best from home, but design best from cafes. Paying attention to ourselves, our energy, and our needs is critical to producing good work!Bonus - Measure everything! Any good business does this, but creatives and self-employed often forget.  If you’re not measuring and you don’t know what’s working (or not), everything you do is a blind guess. Make sure to look at your analytics (like social media metrics, email open rates, and Google Analytics) to see what works well, what doesn’t and adjust your programs accordingly. Bottom line? Tony Robbins Business Mastery was an amazing experience for me - not just from an information and learning standpoint, but also from a networking standpoint.   I’d never invested that much in myself before, unless you count my MBA, and it was worth every penny.   I made a dozen or so incredible friends and business connections, had a ton of fun and got completely re-energized in my business. I was able to see where I was playing small and where I really needed to spend time to get my business to where I want it. My life, and business, will never be the same. Have you ever thought about attending a Tony Robbins live event?  If we’re connected on social media, you know how much these events have changed my life and that I cannot recommend them enough. Within a year of attending Unleash the Power Within, I’m down 3 dress sizes, wake up everyday with energy and have managed to travel to 14 countries while building my business. I honestly don’t think I would’ve had the success I’ve had this year if I hadn’t gotten the jumpstart I got at UPW… and I know I’m just starting to reap the benefits of Business Mastery and Date with Destiny. If you’ve ever considered it, just do it - you will not regret it.  You can find tickets to his next event at TonyRobbins. com. "

    "title": "Moving Forward in Business (Despite Crippling Fear)",
    "body": "2017/10/27 - Ya’ll, I’m tired. I was chatting with a friend of mine this morning about my webinar (which didn’t go as anticipated), and she reminded me of something profound:  “With people who are successful we only hear of their successes, not all the behind the scenes day to day trials and errors. ” Well, I don’t want to mislead you into thinking that building a business is always easy. I’ve been successful and I’ve been a failure and right now I’m somewhere in-between. I fail on a weekly basis at something in my life and new business but I’m still an “overnight success” in the making.  One of my coaches, Tony Robbins, likes to say that you’ll be rewarded publicly for what you do privately.  If you get up everyday at 6am to train for a marathon, no one will know. But you’ll finish the race.  If you give up 30 minutes of television everyday, no one will know, but they’ll enjoy reading your book when it comes out.  If you sacrifice vacation days to grow your “sidehustle” to a point you can leave your day job, no one will know, but they’ll hire you anyway.  If you nearly go bankrupt launching your first business, but finally get it right on your last try, you’ll still be called an overnight success. And that’s kind of where I’m at with this business. I became a coach because I believe life is too short to simply exist - and I want to help people design amazing lives. And I absolutely love what I do. But I made mistakes in my new business early on and I’m nearly out of cash, which scares the living hell out of me. Right now, I’m like a duck - calm on the surface but paddling like mad to keep afloat and wondering if I’ve made a mistake. This is part of the up and down, chaotic, totally exciting entrepreneur life. One day, you’re on top of the world. The next day you’re not sure if you’re on the right path at all. But, what I’ve found is that if I keep going, in-spite of the fear and self-doubt and shame, I’m far more likely to succeed than I am if I give up. So keep going. Keep paddling. I believe in you. Let me know how I can help. XO "

    "title": "Recovering From Corporate Burnout: My Story, Part 3",
    "body": "2017/09/17 - Feeling stressed, depressed, anxious or dreaming of quitting your job to live on the beach? You could be showing signs of corporate burnout. : This is post three of a three post series on my recovery - from the early signs of corporate burnout to full on depression and back to health and happiness. You might want to read Part I and Part II first. PART III: LIFE WITHOUT FEAR The last time I jumped back into consulting, I made better decisions. I had to. I’d just moved across country and bought a home in Savannah, Georgia (where I didn’t know anyone).  I decided I was starting a business, not just grabbing onto work thrown my way.  I decided I was worth investing in, and I found the training and resources I needed.  I decided to focus on who I wanted to serve, instead of chasing clients who were looking for a one-off project at the lowest price.  I decided I was going to be successful and I would do whatever it takes. This was pivotal for me, and where things really started to click into place. My life got exponentially better. Looking back at my last few years working that corporate “dream job,” my default mode was panic. I awoke each morning with fear, dread, and deep unhappiness. It was exhausting. Burnout – emotional and physical – had taken a huge toll on my well being. In the years following my quitting, I strove for better and better. Finally, I’m here, living a life that brings me joy, and fills me with gratitude. Now when I wake up, I’m excited and greet the day with questions like: “What do I get to do today?” or “Who do I get to help?” I’ve built my life around the right choices for me, so I’m full of energy to use to serve others. I’ve since left Savannah to travel, and even recently put my house on the market. I’ve pivoted my business to focus on coaching and education over consulting, so I can serve more people. I’m building a business where I get to work with my type of people: entrepreneurial, creative, and non-traditional. I’ve found my tribe, one where “that’s just how it’s always been done” is never the answer. But the biggest change is that I’ve nearly eliminated fear from my life. Fear of what “might” happen, fear of judgement from others, fear that others’ actions can invalidate my worth, fear that I’m “less than,” fear that someone won’t like me, fear of dying alone and being eaten by cats… Okay, that one still pops up occasionally, but hey – progress not perfection. In practice, this has meant cutting negative people out of my life, and prioritizing myself.  It’s meant recognizing what serves me, and what doesn’t.  It’s meant knowing just because someone doesn’t want to date me, or fund me, or work with me, doesn’t mean I’m worthless. Or even uncool. Although really, I am kind of uncool. And I’m okay with that.  It’s meant not taking things personally, and knowing that someone else’s actions usually don’t reflect on me.  It’s meant quitting really cool travel programs because it’s interfering with my business. And I’m okay with all of these things because I feel aligned with my heart. Heart leads head. In this new life, there is more positivity, and there aren’t many big deals anymore. Compared to when I first started showing signs of corporate burnout - when EVERYTHING was a big deal &amp; reasons to be upset - this is a HUGE deal There are occasionally big deals in life, of course, but I almost never choose to get bent out of shape or suffer anymore. Instead of focusing on fear, I focus on the positive or the productive. I frame the world as a place where people are good, and I live better for it. When terrorists attacked Barcelona’s Las Ramblas in August 2017 – an area I walked by multiple times every day that week – it could have been easy to fixate on the one cruel person who inflicted so much suffering. On the cruelty of the world we live in. Instead of doing so, I found it better to follow Mr. Rogers’ advice and “look for the helpers. ” I focused my energy on the 1,000’s of people who showed up to help, to support, to radiate goodness. When we look at the world this way, it’s brimming with kindness, not one to inhabit in fear. I wake up happy most days. Even days that are hard, I’m able to find the good. To make a little progress. These days, I typically don’t work more than 30 hours a week on average. I work with my body clock, not an arbitrary 9-to-5. I focus on maximizing what I’m good at, and I look for help where I’m not. As I follow the path the universe lays out before me, I’m rewarded with incredible experiences and opportunities to build my tribe. I run into fellow traveler who guide my along my journey, and I help them along with theirs. This is my life now, and I’ve designed it in a way that works for me. Scary things may come my way, but I’m equipped with gratitude, heart, tribe, and passion.  What more could a girl ask for? Everything I do is with the intention of supporting other people in their desire to change their life or business. I get to serve others and watch them grow. And it’s simply amazing. If you’re finding yourself dreaming about quitting your job, are anxious or bitter and dread getting out of bed to go to work, you could be showing signs of corporate burnout, which puts you at a greater risk for stress-related illness - it’s not a terrible idea to consult a licensed clinician to for help. This is part three of a three part series. See Part I and Part II for more info on how I went from burnout and addiction to six-figure entrepreneurship. "

You could be suffering from corporate burnout. : This is part two of a three post series sharing my story of recovering from corporate burnout. Missed Part One? Read it here. PART II: MAKE BETTER DECISIONS In 2014 I took I life changing trip to Bali and Cambodia. It was a vacation from that last dream job, which was taking over my life, and starting to kill my spirit again. During the 1,000 flight to Siem Reap, I read The 4-Hour Work Week and, for the first time, it clicked in my head that there was a whole other way to live. There was no reason I needed to be in a cubicle, or an office at all, and no reason to work 40-hours a week, every single week, for the rest of my life. I saw possibilities I hadn’t seen before, and an entire world opened for me. So often, we’re taught to settle for mediocrity: get a decent job, work hard, be a decent person, and get rewarded with your mediocre retirement plan. All of a sudden, it wasn’t enough. I was DONE settling. On the same trip, I visited Angkor Wat. It was around 4,000 degrees outside, and the air was liquid it was so humid, so I had the place to myself, save for a handful of tourists and monks. I climbed to the top of the sacred temple and came to a window that looked out into blue skies, lush jungle and the quiet sounds of nature. As I approached the window, I burst into tears as waves of joy washed over me. I was overcome with an intense wave of peace, love and belonging. I felt whole. Connected. I still get chills thinking about it. I decided then and there to change my life, again. I decided I would travel more and inspire others – to live their passion, to lead happier lives, to stop living to work, to question the status quo… I particularly wanted to serve women like me. I wanted to inspire women to feel happy, healthy, and fulfilled. To know they were enough, just as they were. These weren’t dreams. They were decisions. I wasn’t concerned with “how” – I knew I’d get there – I just had to start. To manifest these decisions, I made more big changes in my life. I got really clear on how I was spending my time, money and energy. I began cutting out things that weren’t important. I started taking care of my body and getting medical treatment for what would later be diagnosed as an endocrine disorder. I had to make massive changes, again, and it was so hard. But it was these moments – the revelations in my travel, my committed decisions, and my making tradeoffs as an entrepreneur – that have landed me where I am, living a life I deeply love.  “It’s your decisions, not your conditions, that determine your destiny” Tony Robbins Every choice we make as entrepreneurs have impact on our lives and livelihood. The right choices matter. And nearly everything in life is a choice. So often, I talk to people who claim to want to make a change in their lives but fail repeatedly. It’s not because they don’t want it. It’s not because they can’t do it. 9 times out of 10, it’s because they cannot or will not prioritize.  Instead of investing time into their business, they spend hours scrolling through Facebook.  Instead of investing money in their business, they blow it on shoes or the newest Prada bag.  Instead of continuing to make a little progress each day, they lose momentum and give up.  Instead of taking care of themselves, they give all of their energy away to others. We have to decide to stop doing the things that hurt us and make better decisions. For me, I had to give up shopping as a hobby and weekly trips to Target. I had to budget funds to pay debt and save for travel. I had to cut out gluten and reduce my sugar and take supplements and go to meetings and physical therapy and acupuncture and learn to meditate. I had to question all of the things I knew to be true. I was living in Portland, Oregon where you can literally go weeks without seeing the sun and I was pretty over it, so I got permission from my then boss to work remotely and spend winter in the South. I started blogging again and created the foundation for what’s now my coaching business, though I didn’t know it at the time. After two months in Charleston and Savannah, I found myself crying all the way home – through the entire five hour flight – and knew something was wrong. It was crazy to move across country and so I fought the idea for a year, tried to come up with alternate plans that were rational. Then I visited Savannah again and felt home. So I moved across country by myself. It was one of the best decisions I ever made, even if I only stayed a year. That was when I learned to trust my gut and follow my heart over everything else. And was a catalyst for quitting that last dream job and making new decisions. This is part two of a three part series – you can go back to read PART ONE or move on to part three: Life Without Fear! "

    "body": "2017/09/17 - Feeling stressed, depressed, anxious or dreaming of quitting your job to live on the beach? You could be suffering from corporate burnout. This is part 1 of my story of recovering from corporate burnout. : PART I: SUFFERING IS A CHOICE I started my corporate career in what you might describe as a “dream job. ” I worked for a global sportswear company doing fun &amp; creative work, with people I loved.  It was amazing. And then, slowly, it wasn’t. It became a nightmare. I was working sixty to eighty hours a week. I’d come home most days to microwave a meal, binge Netflix, and drink or cry (or both!) myself to sleep. I knew there was more to life, but I didn’t have the energy for it. I kept thinking something would change. The new CEO would fix things, a different project would help… but it never did. I found myself bitter and angry most of the time, which isn’t who I am at my core. I realized I was responsible for changing my life – only me – and it was a choice to continue to suffer in a job I hated, waiting for my circumstances to change. I quit that job without a plan in 2008. I didn’t have savings, or know what was coming next. I don’t come from money, had a lot of student debt and no safety net. But I knew if I stayed in that job, I would end up killing myself in some manner or another. I took piecemeal work to survive, and a series of corporate jobs that weren’t ideal but paid the bills and padded the resume. I started to breathe a little, and to see brief flashes of a life worth living. Nothing felt clear, but I took time to explore and recover, while I earned my master’s degree in business. I still thought I’d be working in the corporate world forever, and I wanted to understand what was going on in in these companies. When I graduated, my plan was to move to Silicon Valley. I had a vision of a future where I’d take a job at a start-up, work for a few years, and ultimately became a project manager at Apple before doing my own thing. I was gonna be the next Guy Kawasaki. It was awesome. So I did it. I got a job in the Valley, and moved down. And, guess what? It sucked. It was worse than anything I thought could have been true about the Valley. Everything you’ve seen on HBO’s Silicon Valley is accurate. The start-up worked for was in a shitty, shitty office park with no character, sandwiched between a tire store and a Walgreens. But the parking lot was full of Maseratis and Ferraris. The work wasn’t much better. We spent all of our time focusing on competitors and preparing for the next board meeting, and no time thinking about our users or audiences. I felt like we were serving no one, and really just treading water. I hated it, and I started drinking myself to sleep every night. But there was a silver lining… I got to try my hand at entrepreneurship and working in a startup, and I loved it. I’ve always been a huge learner. I love to read, be hands-on, try new things; I loved getting my hands dirty in a million different parts of the company. I liked seeing what worked and what didn’t and testing everything. Even though I was languishing in that shitty Mountain View office park, I’d found something I loved. Eventually, I quit. Again, I didn’t have a set plan, but I knew I could start freelancing. It was hard. I struggled a lot, flailing for piecemeal work, and didn’t know who I was targeting. I didn’t think about my work as a viable business, but as a mix of short-term projects that would pay the bills. Or not. I was stressed out all the fucking time, and I didn’t have good coping mechanisms at the time. I smoked and drank and ate and binged, because I didn’t know better ways to manage my stress. Whether it’s alcohol, drugs, food, online shopping, or something else, we can all fall into the trap of unhealthy coping mechanisms. To be effective as an entrepreneur, we have to quit these. I learned that the hard way. During a particularly challenging period I realized my problem with alcohol was beyond poor coping and I made the decision to quit behavior that didn’t serve me. I found the resources I needed to quit drinking, started focusing on self-care, learned how to recover from corporate burnout - and stopped shaming myself. My entire world changed with that decision. By making changes to what I put in my body, how I lived my life and how I treated myself physically, I started to recover from my corporate burnout… and, more importantly, I started to return to being a happy human being. I started to feel healthier and more vibrant, and was kinder to my body and mind. I had more energy to pour into my business and into my life. In retrospect, it might seem quick to sum up these changes, but they. were. so. hard. During this time, I dug myself into a financial hole. I had to short-sell my home and move into my friend’s basement. It was brutal, and it’s taken a long time to get out of the deep financial hole I dug. But through it all, I learned. I got closer to who I wanted to work with and, more importantly, who I didn’t want to work with. Along the way, I took a full-time job to start getting myself out of my financial hole. I liked the project and the people; it was good work, a dream job by many other people’s standards. I was – and still am – passionate about the project, and it was a crucial stepping stone to where I am now, but it just wasn’t it. Not yet.

We get to this point because we let intangible clutter take over our calendars, then our minds and our lives. Luckily, we can clear the clutter. We can get things done, and be less overwhelmed.    We usually overestimate what we can do in a day, but underestimate what we can do in a year. If we don’t learn to control the clutter and focus, we don’t end up living up to our full potential. This means saying “no” to more, making sure our to-do lists shrink and (most importantly) relying less on our memory so we can free up our minds to focus on the big stuff! There are all kinds of tools that can help build a workflow, and apps often give you the most bang for your buck. After several years of honing, I’ve settled on my top picks and have a great routine that works for me. Here are my top five apps, which each have made my days less frantic and more productive. [/et_pb_text][et_pb_blurb title=”Five Minute Journal “ url=”http://app. fiveminutejournal. com/” url_new_window=”on” image=”https://katebagoy. com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/productivity-apps-for-focus-5-minute-journal. png” image_max_width=”none” admin_label=”5-Min Journal” _builder_version=”3. 0. 87” border_style=”solid”]Why: Gives me an awesome dose of gratitude and focus, daily. How it works: I use the Five Minute Journal app every day. In the morning, I use it to record the things I’m grateful for, and start the day on a positive note, then I create my priorities so that I know exactly what will make the day successful! At night, I use the app to record three amazing things that happened, upload a photos and note what could have gone better. I go to bed feeling grateful and ready to keep improving.       The same company also sells great hardback planners and journals here.

How it works: I use One Big Thing to identify the one thing that is most important to me each day. I log the one thing that I must do, so there’s no confusion about where my focus should be. This level of extreme focus means that my goal for the day - and also my measure of success - is crystal clear. It’s super useful if you’re easily overwhelmed, and want a reminder of how you should make decisions throughout the day. If you’re a new entrepreneur, this is a way to streamline your daily work so that it gets you closer to cash sooner.

How it works: I use Todoist as a place to dump the contents of my brain. From ideas, to blog posts, to errands, to opportunities, it catches it all. Todoist has desktop and smartphone apps, browser plugins, and email customizations. Using these different channels, I can do things like create project-based to-do lists, schedule recurring tasks, create reminders, and assign priorities. What do I get out of it? A clear, running list of ideas that I can pull from. Most importantly, I get a clearer mind. By dumping important - but not immediately needed - information there, I can keep my brain on task and not be afraid of forgetting something.

How it works: The apps I use for this are more diverse, but they fall into one category: tools to capture inspiration, and clear digital clutter. These apps store content I find that keeps me excited or informed, whether it’s an interesting article on a related industry, or a really cool tool that would be helpful to a client, or notes that I might flesh out into a blog or social post. I use browser plugins along with the app versions of Google Keep, Pocket &amp; Evernote to bookmark articles, keep samples of great copy, or save interesting photos. This turns into a record of the things that shape my work, and a place I can always turn to for ideas - without taking up space when I need to focus.

How it works: I try to learn something every day that is going to help me in my business, and you in yours! To do this, I listen to books or book summary on audio or podcasts to make use of “no extra time” time, like when I’m walking or driving somewhere. This turns “down time” into productive time. One of my favorites is Blinkist, which has summaries of productivity books, and extracts presents the most important points in a quick-to-understand way. Choosing to learn one thing every day will improve anyone’s business, and is a really important step for everyone.

    "title": "50 Tools I Use to Run My Online Business",
    "body": "2017/08/17 - HOW TO TAKE YOUR BUSINESS ONLINE: TOOLS EVERY ENTREPRENEUR NEEDS TO WORK AROUND THE WORLD These days, unless you have brick &amp; mortar store or restaurant, there are very few businesses that can’t be operated online with the right tools. Here are the most critical tools and software I use to run my business while traveling the world as a digital nomad. Essentials: If pressed, I could run my business online using only these tools. Cloud Storage: Dropbox There are plenty of cloud storage tools out there, but I’ve been a customer of Dropbox since they were in beta, and I literally don’t know what I’d do without them. I store 95% of my files on Dropbox, which comforts me knowing that if I loose my laptop in Laos I can instantly access my critical docs and be set up on a new system in a matter of hours. I can also seamlessly access nearly every file I’ve ever created from my phone, iPad, laptop or friends computer. Email &amp; Word Processing: Google Apps I have both a personal and business account with Google, and use Gmail for 80% of my communications and Docs/Drive for word processing and spreadsheets. Scheduling: Calendly I use Calendly to schedule calls with friends and family, and consultations or meetings with new clients - it’s super easy to set up and eliminates all the back and forth of finding a time that works for everyone. I also use Accuity for coaching clients, because it’s better for tracking packages and allowing for recurring scheduling - but Calendly makes it really easy to offer instant booking. Communications: Zoom. us Nearly all of my client calls and consultation meetings are taken using my Zoom room. Video is great for feeling connected to your client and more “in the room,” although audio only calls are also available. Video conferencing takes a little getting used to - sometime you talk over each other - but with a little practice it gets easier and you’ll still feel connected to people you don’t see regularly. Zoom is particularly great because you get a standard link you use to kick off a call instead of a constantly changing meeting ID or having to place a skype call. VOIP: Google Voice &amp; MJ Connect When I left the states, I ported the cell phone number I’d had for 15 years to Google Voice for $20, and now people can call me no matter where I am. With a $10 subscription to Magic Jack and a forwarding number, I can call anyone in the US via hangouts just like a regular phone call, and even get text messages. As long as I have a SIM card with data or Wi-fi, there is no issue with missed calls. Website: Wordpress I hacked together my first Wordpress site in 2008, using online tutorials to teach myself how to set it up, modify PHP and make it look reasonably how I envisioned. I’ve gotten a bit better at the tools, and now there are millions of articles and companies devoted to helping people with Wordpress - and you can build a nice site without learning how to code. It’s my top choice for building a website unless you are a startup that needs custom dev. Even then - you should probably run your marketing site in WP for rapid iteration and content management. :) Financial and Security: Passwords: One Password If you are one of those people that use the same password for everything, you know you’re playing with fire. Instead of worrying how you’re going to remember your password, invest in 1P and  save yourself. I currently have 685 logins saved in 1P, which I can access from my browser or phone. As long as I don’t lose my master password, I wont get locked out of another site again. 1 Password also stores secure notes, identification information and credit cards - so I can make a purchasing using any of my cards with the browser extension. Payment: Stripe Want to take payments online? Stripe or Paypal are the easiest solutions to setup, and Stripe made it possible for me to take credit cards over the phone when talking to a client, for a low per-transaction fee. I’m not sure if it’s still the same, but when I set this up Paypal required a Pro account for the same service. Security: Strong VPN I’ll be honest and admit that 95% of the reason I use Strong VPN is to watch Netflix or Comcast while abroad, but it’s a good idea to have for securing your network when on public wi-fi and for accessing financial sites in the US. The setup wasn’t too difficult and works on multiple devices so I’m always covered. Bookkeeping: Quickbooks Self-Employed If you’re a US based freelancer or service provider who needs to pay IRS quarterly taxes, this will save you a lot of hassle. It’s also great for keeping track of your personal vs. business expenses when you’re still working on a side hustle vs. a full-blown business. If you’re boostrapping, it’s going to be very important that you know if that meal you charged to your account was for biz or personal use. Quickbooks makes that pretty easy and incorporates nicely with other intuit products. Web + Wordpress: Hosting: Siteground I’ve tried a ton of webhosts in the last couple decades working as a web designer and webmaster. I moved all of my personal AND client WordPress sites to SiteGround in 2016. I’ve had virtually no downtime, and their customer service is phenomenal. It’s really world’s apart from others the best WordPress hosting I’ve personally used – without destroying your budget. Domains &amp; Domain Management: Namecheap I collect domains like some women collect shoes. If you have the same entrepreneurial nature, you might consider consolidating all your domains under one manager. For years I bought domains from my host, but then I would switch hosts and still have to maintain logins to route DNS servers… just a bit of a mess. Namecheap is, well, cheap, and also has good customer service &amp; a nice interface for managing domains. (P. S. I’ve let a few domains expire so I’m now down to less than 20 – all of them are managed by Namecheap). Wordpress Theme: Divi by Elegant Themes I’ve been an Elegant Themes customer since 2011 and after testing quite a few premium themes, I’ve decided Divi is the best WordPress theme. This site uses Divi because it is one of the most versatile and configurable themes or frameworks I’ve ever used that is still very easy for anyone to use. Divi ships with pre-made layouts or you can build from scratch. And again, their customer service is excellent – which is always worth paying for. Wordpress Training: Website in a Week by Rebecca Lutz I built my first WordPress site from scratch around 2009 and have been learning slowly for years. I wish I had had a course like this one then that would have saved me literally 1000’s of hours. A lot of my clients ask me about building a WordPress site and for awhile I was planning to create a course on how to build a WordPress site. Thankfully, I met Rebecca Lutz and found out she’d already created the course so I don’t have to! She’s done a truly fantastic job, and you can try it free for 7-days.

    "title": "9 Signs You're Burnt Out - I Talk to Mental Floss",
    "body": "2017/08/14 - This interview was conducted by Mental Floss writer Zoe Weiner, and was originally published at MentalFloss. com in April 2017. View the original article here. It may come after six months or six years, but there’s a moment in every job when you realize you’ve reached your limit. Whether it’s due to burnout, boredom, or a generally bad fit, you’ll eventually get to a point where you’ve simply been doing the same thing for too long and find yourself unhappy and unfulfilled. It’s not always easy to recognize, but it’s important to act on that “Aha!” moment when it hits so that you don’t waste any more time in a stagnating career. So how do you know you’ve been in a job too long? We spoke to career coaches Kate Bagoy and Rebecca Thompson, both of whom burnt out in their previous roles—Kate in consulting and Thompson in politics—and now use their experiences to advise others who find themselves in the same boat. “People stay in things way too long,” says Thompson, who stuck with a job for five years even though she knew it wasn’t the right fit after six months. “Know when it’s time to get out, and get out. ” According to Bagoy and Thompson, here are the key signs you’ve been in a job too long: 1. You’re Counting Your Sick Days. : Playing hooky is fun to think about, but if you’re regularly considering pulling a Ferris Bueller, it’s a pretty clear indication that you’re unhappy. “If you get up too many days in a row and think, ‘I don’t want to go to work,’ ‘How many sick days do I have left?’ ‘Would anybody even notice if I show up today?’” says Bagoy, “for me, that’s the first sign that’s something is wrong. ” 2. You Feel Like All Of Your Creativity Has Been Drained. : No matter your industry, you should spend most of your time feeling inspired by your job, not beaten down by it. “That burnout from my job was seeping over into the rest of my life,” says Bagoy. “It had eaten up all of my creative energy and my joy. ” If you feel like your role is taking too much brain-power and not allowing you to keep those creative juices flowing, it may be time to make a change. 3. You’ve Stopped Participating In Other Aspects Of Your Life. : Being tired after a long day at the office is one thing, but being burnt out is another, and it’s important to know the difference. “I was so miserable in the eight hours a day I was in my job that I had nothing left,” says Bagoy.  “I would come home, microwave a plate, binge-watch Netflix, and go to bed. ” When you’re burnt out, the rest of your life suffers, and you can use that as an indicator that things aren’t working. And, Bagoy says, if you find yourself using addictive behaviors like drinking, binge-eating, or online shopping to numb yourself to the burnout, get out of there fast. 4. You’re Dreaming Of Leaving A High-paying Job For Minimum Wage. : “I used to fantasize about leaving my six figure role to go flip burgers,” says Thompson, while Bagoy used to “dream about going to work at Starbucks, even if it meant going to work 80 hours a week to make up the salary. ” If the tax on your mental energy is so high that you’re dreaming of doing anything else, just to give your brain a break, get out. 5. You’ve Exhausted Your Opportunities For Growth. : Not every job is meant to launch an entire career (otherwise turnover rates would be non-existent) and that’s totally OK. Think about each role as a steppingstone, and know what you want out of the position when you start. When you feel like you’ve learned and grown in every way that you can, move on. “Get what you came to get, then get out,” says Thompson. 6. You Aren’t Getting Promoted. : While you shouldn’t necessarily expect a promotion every year, if there is no room for any upward movement—or if your peers are consistently beating you out for more senior positions—there’s no point in staying in a role any longer than you have to. Have an honest conversation with your boss about whether or not there are any options for you within the company, and if there’s no possibility that you’ll get promoted or your role will change, take your services elsewhere. 7. You Can Tell Your Performance Is Slipping. : For a while, you may be able to get away with it, but eventually people will notice. Don’t allow yourself to settle for doing a mediocre job, and don’t wait for your supervisor to talk to you about it; use your drop-off in performance as a sign that your mental capacity can be better used somewhere else. 8. You’re On Autopilot. : No matter how much you love your job, some days are going to be more productive than others. But if you’re spending the majority of your time scrolling through E! News or hammering away like a mindless monkey at a keyboard, make the conscious decision to put your brain to better use elsewhere. 9. You want To Get Fired. : When you’re fantasizing about getting fired so that you don’t have to go to work another day, it’s time to quit. “I knew [my company] wanted me to quit, instead of firing me,” says Thompson. Of course, getting laid off may have certain financial benefits, but waiting it out and letting your performance slip in the hopes that you’ll be let go isn’t doing anyone, most of all you, any favors. What do you think – have you been your job too long? Now that you know the signs, do you think it’s time to move on? If it is, have you considered freelancing or consulting?

Maybe the 3rd time’s a charm here. Maybe my laptop didn’t like it, but we are back. So, thank you for everybody that is joining us today. Kate and I are live in Lisbon. I am Carin, I am the founder and front woman of Pairs Well With a story telling business a social media strategist that helps business, entrepreneur, and other small businesses get off the ground and work on their social strategy. So, thanks for joining today. So, I am with Kate Bagoy, who is on this crazy wild journey I am on traveling around the world. She has been a great collaborative partner this year. We spend a lot of time and working together. I brought Kate out because I think she is a great guest on this video cast to talk about inspiration, life, and how to reach your goals and dreams. So, you want to share a little bit of your back story? {01. 26} Kate Sure! Hi, everyone! I am Kate Bagoy. I am a business coach and a business strategist. Also, a former user experience designer &amp; a lifestyle designer. I think I was no longer going to settle for a mediocre life about 5 years ago. At that time I was struggling a lot with my drinking. So, I quit drinking and I am sort of on this trajectory on creating this life I love. that has brought me all around the world. At the time I was living in Portland and since then I have been across the country to Savannah, GA, where I call home, and I was just starting to get settled there when I decided to get crazy and join Remote Year and I have been doing that for the past 6 months. Now I am departing from Remote Year for my own thing, which is kind of exciting. In the meanwhile, I am getting to help women grow businesses and that was my #1 dream. {02:07} Carin Kate is a great source of inspiration for all of in the group. She has a lot of tips on how to lead your most authentic life, how to focus on the ideal client, how to make that move from corporate America to entrepreneurially endeavors. Do you want to share a little bit about your story about what was your jump off point was to leave corporate America, the cubicle farm you talk about, to starting your own business? {02:14} Kate Sure. So, I have left corporate America a couple of times. But, I think the more dramatic and impactful one for me was in 2008. I had started my career with a really great company. I was my dream job when I started. In about 5 years I was at a point where I didn’t know exactly what I wanted to do, but if I kept doing this I was going to kill myself or kill somebody else, and so it was time to go. So, I quit without a plan. Now, I call it taking a leap of faith and that is what that really was. I was burnt out and said, screw this. I cannot do this anymore. ” , and “I don’t know what I will do, but it is not this. ”. It was one of the best decision I have ever made. It was hard, it was challenging, it was one of the first times I initially started running my own business as a home-business working as a freelance designer and it was an absolute disaster. Because, I didn’t know what I was doing. I would scramble for any type of work that would come my way. I would take any client that would pay attention to me. So, I earned, I was basically competing on dollar amount instead of the value I could provide. But, it led me to a point where I went back to school and I got my Master’s in Business Administration and moved to Silicon Valley to work for another start-up there. Again, that was another disaster and it was an example to me for not listening to my “gut”. I took that job even though everything in my heart and in my soul told me, “this is not the place for you. ” and I took it anyway. That is what happens when you are in your “head”. You do things because it looks great on the resume. Because somebody else tells you are making the right move and mean while you know it is going to be a disaster. {04:21} Carin You start to feel that nagging in your heart and your gut. You try to like, you know, you try to survive. It is a game of survival and ultimately you want to be able to do something. It is hard for a lot of people. I think there are a ton of people that go through life that are sitting at their jobs, regardless of what they do, that are finding themselves wanting to do something different. They find themselves looking over their shoulders consistently but, they don’t know how to take that first move. Whether it be a confidence thing or a financial thing. What advice would you give people about that first step they should take to move into new endeavors? {04:59} Kate The number 1 thing is to start listening to your heart and not your head. I tell my client’s all the time to put your hand on your heart, get quiet, and listen to the “quiet voice”. The “loud voice”, the one that tells you, “you are not good enough”, “that this is crazy”, “that your mother will never approve”. You know the one that says, “you are going to die alone being eating by cats. ” like that is your brain. Your brain is designed to help you survive. When you listen to your brain you often make choice, actually, you make trade offs, that is what we will call that. So, listening to your heart is number 1. Number 2 is making a decision. That is the key to action. Making the commitment to making a decision. You don’t have to know everything that has to come next. But, you can say, “I am going to quit this job. ”, “this doesn’t deserve me. ”, and put it in a timeline and say, “I will quit my job in 2 months and I will have a business lined up. ” or”I will have a new job. ” or whatever. But, make that committed decision. {05:42} Carin I think a lot of people make that committed decision and they keep pushing it out, pushing it out, and pushing it out. And, they are like, “Well, it is going to there. ”, All you do, I am going to tell you first hand, is if you keep pushing it out and it is still there, you are just dragging your feet. Rip the freaking band-aid people and make a move. Because honestly, I probably sat at my shit job a lot longer than I needed to and I was like, “Look at this blissful life. ”. It is awesome! There is nothing better. I didn’t think I was asking for a lot. My main goal are having financial freedom, time flexibility, and ultimately I want to work during my best working hours. I don’t want to be told you have to be here between 3:32 and 3:48 am. That is just not how my brain works. For some people it does. I am not knocking the people that have that lifestyle. But, they just need a little more creativity. That is is just one of those things where you have to make the move. I think that if you have that rub pulled out from under you, tell me if I am on the right page, you are forced to think differently because you don’t have that safety net. You are proficient, you are more sufficient, you’re more perfected and you are like, “Alright, I am going to figure it out”. {07:08} Kate Yeah, absolutely! It has been referred to us as a “hunger”. It is like a hunger, and another thing is “burning the boats”. There is an old story and probably a lot of you hear of it. I don’t remember the exact person, so please forgive me for botching it. So, basically, it was a military maneuver. They were going to take this island. This captain, they all knew they were out numbered, out manned, and most likely going to die on this island. And so what did the captain say to do? Burn the boats because we are not getting out of here alive. That is the only chance they had winning because of all those guys being so hungry for survival that they have to win and beat the other army to steal their boats. So, that is what happens when you quit a job without a plan. Like joining up for something crazy like Remote Year. Not knowing how you are going to make a living. So, you have to listen to your gut and to your heart to see if that is meant for you the answers will come. You have to make that committed decision. Yeah, when you say, “I am going to quit my job at some point”, that is not a committed decision. Like, I actually have my clients create a contract with themselves at sometimes. Like, if they are particularly known for putting things off and I make them write a contract. Like, “I keep a goal that promised to X, Y, or Z by X date. ”, and have it be really detailed and specific. Then you can back design your path as well. That is something I do with people. We look at the vision of the life you want to create in the further and then figure out how to get there. That vision drives you forward instead of the fear of, “Oh! How am I going to eat tomorrow?”. {08:48} Carin I can say that Kate and I did a… I did a coaching session with Kate late last week or the week before. I have to say it was really nice because I had a sounding board. I was like, “Ok, bounce some ideas with me because this is where I think I am going with my business. ”. That helps stream line what I was doing and my type of thinking. So, ultimately there is value in that person that has got that creative business mind that I think I have as well. So, talk to me about what it is like to build a business on the road. I do it too, but it is different in everybody’s business. {09:26} Kate Yeah! As you know it is a challenge. {09:40} Carin What are you talking about? {09:41} Kate You know. We had a really good laugh last week when we had coffee. I was like, “Dude, I spent more time looking for Q-tips this week than I did working on my business. ” {09:39} Carin And I am still looking for trash bags. {09:50} Kate She is still looking for trash bags. These are little idiosyncrasies that we find in cities all around the world. We get kind of caught in the day to day living stuff. So, that can be challenging. We never know when the internet is going to work when traveling. We have days like, I can’t seem to feed myself very well here in Lisbon, I just seem to always find the restaurant that is closed. Aside from that, once you have some tools in place, it is actually really liberating. Because, like you said, I can work when it suits me. It suits my biological schedule and my creativity schedule. One of my biggest pet-peeves when we are working for anyone, even if it is jobs that I love, is like working from 8 – 5 because that is just what you do. If I don’t have 9 hours to work then I shouldn’t be in a cubicle. In fact, there have been many studies that show that people are most effective in shorter bursts. Like a good 4 hour workday is really solid. That is a really solid makerspace to put your head down and get some real quality work done. So, I love being able to do that when I am on the road. I am personally inspired by travel. I have always have been. So, being in a new city really brings that creativity for me. So, that has been really helpful with my business. Also, it is about learning the tools that work for you. So, in my business, I am able to use Calendly, which allows me to book calls or video calls with my clients or potential clients. It also calculates time-zone issues for me. I love to use Zoom meetings and things like that. So, using those tools is really important. Other than that it is really about the hustle. The biggest challenge with that is this Remote Year is budgeting the time between wanting to enjoy the lifestyle and wanting to grow my business. Because I think like you, my business is more than just a paycheck. This is part of my mission in life is to help other women and to inspire women to travel and live their life with purpose. So, that is really important to me and that means I have other trade offs that I have to let go of. That means I have to be really guarded with my time and sometimes other people don’t understand that. {12:12} Carin Time is precious. It allows to get stuff done, it allows us to make money, and it allows us to network. What would you say besides time is the other biggest drive in success? {12:40} Kate I think having a vision is really important. It so easy for an entrepreneur or a small business owner to get so caught up the day to day and the busy. We become addicted to the busy. I do this, my task list is where my ideas go to die. I am serious, I have had so many great ideas over the years and I put them on my tasks list and it is just a hot mess. When I become overloaded when I become scared, and when I go into feelings of self-doubt or self-worth I become busy and I will pick things out of my to-do box that really doesn’t matter. In the long run, this stuff is not going to move the needle, to use one of those awful cliche sayings. But, when I focus on the vision and I focus on the goal which to inspire others and to educate other. Then I can take special actions towards that and then I can say, “what is my next step?” and I do more powerful things. So, I think vision is very very critical. {14:01} Carin I agree. How would you guys… I know it took me awhile like my vision was here and then it was there. Last week I went through this moment of a Post-It moment and I had to take over my room with Post-Its. I was like this is so stupid. So, I was trying to get organized and streamlined because I will do this thing where I will do all these mundane tasks to keep busy and act like I am being productive. But, like you said, I am not doing anything to move the needle. So, it is very important to make sure you are prioritizing the things that will do the best for yourself, your business, your kids, and for everything you do in your life and having some sort of strategy behind that. So, let’s switch gears a bit… What questions do you guys have so far? Feel free to shoot us some questions. Things like, what is it like being on the road? What is it like to catch a catfish with your hands in Vietnam? Um you know, Thai food poisoning for days? Things like those questions. Oh yeah! So we are sitting here right before we get started and I look over at Kate’s computer. It has this little highlight that says, “I microwave my pants”. I am like, “What up on your computer?” She said, “Awesome! Can I hear the story?” And, I still don’t have the full story, so I am still curious, so go for it. {15:03} Kate It is just one of those little things that you have to deal with on the road. So, what you have experienced, you sort of getting used to it after awhile you are on a long term travel. And you tend to usually forget how it is unusual that you are used to things not working. Today what I realized was the one thing I really miss from home, more than my friends and more than my favorite places, is my laundry room. Because this morning I really wanted to go to the gym and my pants were still wet and I practically live in a basement and hadn’t air dry after 18 hours, I had to microwave my workout pants in an effort to have some gear to go to the gym. So, when you have a 20 piece wardrobe you don’t have extras like that. Which means I either go to the gym in jeans or I just don’t go to the gym. {15:55} Carin Usually, that means you end up in all black. That means most of your wardrobe is black. {16:05} Kate Yeah, so that means that is one of those little Nomad things. That was the starting of the post and I will kind of go on to other things I have learned in my Remote Year. Which, who I was talking to about last week is what we have learned on this trip and what this trip is kind of about. For me, I think this journey was learning how to live without. {16:33} Carin Agreed! So, the question from Kathryn says, ” What business have you worked on recently remotely that you have run into roadblocks that make you feel like you would approach differently now that you know different things?” But, would you approach it now differently? {17:02} Kate Absolutely! That is the benefit of hindsight. That is true if we knew now what we knew then we would do things differently. From a business standpoint … I started my own business right around the same time I started Remote Year. I abandon a lucrative business with doing that. Because I am an all in kind of person or an in the moment kind of person. But, in hindsight when I think of the timing and facing the challenges while on the road I probably would have kept a little bit of design work. That way I was a little more financially sound and so concerned about where the money was going to come from. {17:30} Carin Kristina had a question. What business opportunities are you missing out on by being abroad? I guess the easy answer to that one would be stability, right? I have been in the game for almost 15 years now and being able to pick up a… whether it be a freelance job or I could have moved into a different role in Minneapolis or get a different job I think. There are probably other marketing jobs I could have gotten into but I felt like the timing was right and even as resistant I was to leave my job I was being pushed by the universe. Kind of like, “Nope, you are done here. ” Moving on, so it was just timing. I had been planning on it for a very long time and longed for it for awhile. I was like we are going to do this. No matter if we sink or swim and no safety net we are going to do this no matter what. I think it is funny when people say, “Hey, how is the vacation?” I wish I could a vacation for a year. It makes my nostrils flare. I am like, “Nope. I am not on vacation. ” It’s not like one of those who worked more hours or. . I have people like, that are watching this podcast, that can actually work 8 to 12 hours for free. It is just how we want to structure that work time. But, most of us are out here working very hard, trying to build something great or something with a purpose or something sustainable on the other side. That way we don’t have to go back to what Kate calls the “cubicle farm”. {19:15} Kate Some of us have to take care of what we do that is very creative. Like sometimes I have taken business meetings in alleyways in Asia. Because like you screw up the Time Zone on your calendar or your tuk tuk breaks down or whatever. You just don’t know what is going to happen. {19:39} Carin Like, some of us where the Time Zone changed, So I would have to get up at 2 or 3 am. I would get up at 2 and get ready and tail it to the office space and make sure I looked like I was ready for whatever. Because some of them were video interviews or whatever. You just learn to adapt, you are like, “alright, this is a new one for me. ” {19:48) Kate Back to the previous question about what we have missed out on by being abroad? For my stand point, the way that I have built businesses in the past is being a part of the community and that has been challenging with the short amount of time that we have in each of these cities. So that has been learning different ways of learning on how to get involved and finding community online instead of actually finding local communities. I think that is just something we have to work through as Nomads if we want to continue this lifestyle. So, I am looking up new Meet Ups I can attend in a new city where I will want to meet some new local people to increase my networking or I attend a lot of conferences that way I can meet new people. {20:40} Carin Totally! There has been a lot of good ones this month too. So, I think it when you get involved in the local community you realize all the potential there is out there. This month I got involved with a group, Lean in Lisbon, a woman entrepreneurial group and during another even with them on Tuesday. You really kind of go, this stuff like that happens all over the globe and that is your chance to take those great opportunities as you want to and form those bonds. We have another question from Kristina. How do you remain so positive during surprise cleanses, dog bites, Malaria, and other freak accidents? I will be the first to say that I apparently have a problem walking and it is when I am sober. I wiped out, rolled, slid, and tumbled down some flights of stairs in Belgrade. I was like, “oh my god, is my phone ok? I don’t have money for a new phone right now. ” “Did I lose any teeth? No, we are all good right here. ” No, you got to think it is ok and it was just a moment. You all have had those days or those moments where you’re not feeling well and you need space. That is a hard thing with this group and like there is 60 of us and you’re like, “Can I just get a moment?” Right? And so, having your space or taking that space is a big thing. But, you have to let it out however you need to and take a step back and really be able to go, “Ok! A positive event is taking place and we are going out there. ” I think for me it is having space. {21:41} Kate It is the space. I think for me it is… I start my day with gratitude and I try to return to gratitude at any giving point. Or at least I try to. So, in the morning, I have an actual morning routine where it allows me to stay focused throughout the day. And that includes writing some papers for you all that have seen the Artist Way and I also have an app called 5 Minute Journaling that I use for the 3 things I am grateful for, the 3 things I can make great and an incantation. When you are in gratitude it is really hard to be angry, to be upset, or to be anything else. I have to be honest when there were days in Asia where I had guiardia or when I thought I where I might die from rabies that after being bitten by a dog and getting the wrong treatment. And the best I could do in gratitude was at least I was still breathing. But, I still came up with 3 things I could be grateful for and that allows me to keep moving. {22:49} Carin So I see it says strength and lots of positivity from you both is so uplifting. Thanks, Mom. Yeah, it was my aunt and she says, “Thank you both for the adaptability and flexibility in your endeavors. I think those are qualities that everyone needs being so far away from home. Thanks, Aunt Kris! So, what is the next… So, unfortunately, Kate is leaving the group after this month. She is going to continue to focus on her own endeavors on her coaching business. So, what do the next couple of months look like for you? {23:27} Kate The next couple of months looks pretty exciting for me. It is weird, but as much as I love my remote European family, and I really do love you guys and I am going to miss you dearly. I am really looking forward to new adventures and having the freedom. It is kind of accelerating to think that I can go wherever I want. Right now I am going to Barcelona which is a city that I just meant just a week ago and we had a fast love affair and it just captured my heart. I just love it there and put my head down to do work for about 6 weeks. Then I am going to the UK where I have a number of friends and where it feels like home. Then I don’t know. Yeah, probably find a place for the winter because I don’t love winters. And continue to work with awesome women, continue to grow, and help inspire others to travel. Because that is part of my soul. {24:24} Carin Oh! I love that. Before we get ready to go, is there a good challenge you can leave this group with? Like something you give them to think about or challenge them with? Something that will better or enrich their lives over the next week? {24:48} Kate I think the biggest challenge I can give anyone is letting go of things that embarrass you. Learn to love it. It is the number one thing I have adapted in my life that allows me to live in gratitude and grace every day. And you can start really small. Start by looking at your closet and those pair pants you haven’t worn in 5 years, just toss it. Get rid of anything that is isn’t pleasing you or serving you. And just move to bigger things like relationships, jobs, and cars. {25:11} Carin I always hear people complaining about their jobs, that is just the big one, I am like, “Get rid of it and find a new one”. {25:26} Kate That’s it! Stop complaining and get a new one. {25:30} Carin Just remember people, you have got skills. So, what is next for me? Well, this is very exciting but I just pulled the trigger the other day and I just shared this with Kate just a second ago, I am going to Africa on Saturday. I just booked a trip to Africa. I am going to spend 4 days in Merica and do some cooking, and some maybe camel riding. I don’t know but there is going to be some pretty cool stuff. I will probably go take a Turkish bath and I am going to live in ??? for a couple days. So, I am really excited to go to Africa. It has been on my list for a very long time. This will be my sixth continent. So, that is 6 continents in 6 months. We will see that gets me and I will meet the rest of the group in Bog. My ultimate goal is too hot off 7 continents. I know it sounds a little lofty and a little aggressive. But, we will figure that out later. The living in Minnesota is close enough to live in Antartica so it is cheaper I am sure, but we will see when we get there. That will give me a little time. {26:42} Kate Maybe you will meet a hot scientist. {24:46} Carin Maybe, that is a possibility. I would like to be a penguin mom there. I want to thank you guys for tuning in and I hope to be able to have more opportunities to have these in each city I am in. If not twice with some very interesting speakers. Go to my Pairs Well With page and there is a link about Kate to learn more about her and sign up for a free no obligation consultation session. She is wonderful. So, check out her page and like my Facebook page so you can get all the upcoming things.   "

    "title": "I microwaved my pants today",
    "body": "2017/07/28 - As a digital nomad, people are always asking what I miss from home.  The food? Rarely. The culture? Nope. Medical care? Just my acupuncturist. My friends? Of course. No one ever guesses what I miss most… my laundry room. I realize this makes me sound like a clean freak, but I assure you I am not.  After 7-months of poor laundry service, washing machines that left clothes stiff or smelling of sewage, and washing skivvies in the sink I’ve reached a new low by microwaving my pants in an effort to dry them faster. You see, I don’t have a backup pair of workout pants. I have an essential wardrobe as I carry my entire life in a backpack as I move from city to city. So if my basement apartment doesn’t have the airflow to dry my pants in 18-hours I either go to the gym in jeans or I don’t go. So, I microwaved my pants today. It’s interesting the things we acclimate to.  I never would have guessed Remote Year would lead to such innovative laundry techniques (I’ve also ironed with a hair dryer before, my friend uses her hair straightener), much less a non-plussed attitude towards not having creature comforts. I’ve gone from living in a 1,200ft2 condo alone, filled with awesome “things” I love, to not knowing where I’ll live next month and carrying less than 20kgs (30lbs) of baggage, which includes everything I need to run a business. It’s liberating as hell. It’s hard to describe the experience of life on the road and what this year has really been about, but if I had to break it down it would be this: This lifestyle is about letting go. “Let go of preconceived notions, fear, the need for certainty, the social constructs we live with, the stories we tell ourselves, expectations and, of course, material goods. ” In February, I had the honor of participating in a lantern ceremony where we wrote our hopes for Remote Year on a lantern before releasing it to the sky. One of my mates hoped for all ‘Remotes’ to find themselves &amp; at the time I remember thinking, “I already know who I am. ” But I could not have been more wrong. I only knew myself in certain terms. I knew who I was in the context of my old life — of being a great designer &amp; a trusted advisor for the startups I worked with — not as a coach and new online marketer. I knew who I was in my social group and as a solo traveler, not as a community member of 60 new faces. I knew who I was with my makeup and hair the way I like it, wearing the clothes I want, not in the 1,000 degree heat of Asia where makeup becomes pointless and I have a 20-piece wardrobe. I’ve learned I’m stronger than I think I am.  That I’m an eternal optimist capable of looking for the lesson or the good in anything. I’ve learned I’m a survivor and a hustler and I’m not willing to settle for mediocrity. I’ve learned that it doesn’t matter what I have, or don’t have, in my life when it comes to being happy and being loved. Those things come from within. And I’ve learned it all by letting go of one thing at a time. Crossposted on Medium "

It’s one of the traits that made me an exceptional UX designer. Actually, it’s almost an obsession now, as being a digital nomad requires that I stay productive as possible. With traveling on a pretty regular basis, it becomes imperative that one stick to a framework that makes getting things done effectively and efficiently as simple as possible.   Nowadays, there’s just so many distractions, it’s any wonder how people manage to get things done at all. So if you’re looking for ways to boost productivity and just get things done, you’ve come to the right place. In this article, I’m sharing my 6 best productivity tips that have helped me to build the life of my dreams. I’ll show you how to maximize productivity so that you too can build that business that will allow you to work anywhere.   6 Productivity Tips to Help You Stay Focused, Be More Productive, and Get Things Done#1) Pick your priorities, or they will pick you. : This is probably one of the most secret tips of being productive that you’ll ever hear. If you keep spending your time on the wrong things, you’ll never be able to get the important things done that truly matter.   Learning how to prioritize is hands down the most important thing you can do for your business and is the key to getting shit done. One way to do this is by simply asking yourself two questions. The first is, “Is this important?” and the second one is, “Will completing this move my business forward?” Once you answer these two questions, you can then decide when or if it needs to be done, or if it is something you can outsource altogether.   A word of caution, just because something may seem urgent does not mean it is truly important. While urgent things require immediate attention; the important things are “of great significance or value” and will help you achieve specific goals. Here’s a good rule of thumb to follow: aim to spend 80% of your time working on important tasks that aren’t urgent, and as little time as possible working on unimportant stuff. This is especially true in regards to personal time-wasters like tv, internet and social engagements. If you want to build a business, you need to guard your time like a bulldog. Building an online business is difficult as it is, so do yourself a favor and stop wasting time doing the things you don’t want to do with people you don’t even want to see. Do remember to take the time to occasionally unplug. Freedom. to is a great way to block social media whenever you need a break. Newsfeed Eradicator will remove your newsfeed from your facebook profile if you have a habit of mindlessly scrolling. #2) Plan your day, and plan to plan. : When entrepreneurs (myself included) aren’t willing to take a step back &amp; strategize effectively, it’s only a matter of time before they revert to living in reactionary mode, especially if they are feeling overwhelmed. Yet, if you fail to plan, you’ll fail to succeed. 100% of the time. In fact, one of the best ways to overcome feelings of overwhelm is to start building in time to focus on strategy and prioritization so you’re not always freaking out about what you have to do next. You just know. Part of effectively planning your day begins with a strong morning routine. If you’ve been following me for any length of time, chances are you’ve likely heard me refer to the power of a morning routine. I credit mine with much of my success over the last couple years. Don’t underestimate how important it is to plan your day, particularly if you’re starting a new business. By having several blocks of time per week dedicated to reviewing and planning built into my Google calendar, I can usually do a weekly (okay, bi-weekly) review of my running task list (in Todoist). Doing this keeps me on track and gives me the opportunity to eliminate anything that’s been taken care of or is no longer relevant. #3) Chunk your time to limit context switching. : While we are on the subject of time blocking, here’s another time management technique that really helps prevent cognitive fatigue and will allow you to make better decisions throughout the day. As much as people like to say they can multitask, fact is our brains aren’t meant to “multi-task” and by keeping tasks aligned, you’ll waste less time mentally switching gears.   The idea behind this is simple: create “chunks” of time throughout your day or week that are focused on specific types of tasks. I personally had heard about this quite a bit for several years and would only implement it in small bursts . However it wasn’t until I started traveling full-time that this became absolutely critical for me to keep moving forward in my business. While there are a number of ways to implement this technique, ranging from rigid 90-minute calendar blocks for writing to daily or weekly “themes. ” I recommend experimenting with different techniques to see what works for you. For me, I found that daily themes work best for me I dedicate Tuesday and Thursday to working with clients and potential clients, so I have my “coaching hat” on all day and don’t have to context switch to marketer, strategist or administrator. Anything I do besides talking to clients is considered a bonus. Wednesday is content creation. Mondays and Fridays are admin and marketing days, or as I like to call them “get shit done” days. I try to limit my working hours on these days to smaller chunks – 4 hours max, usually 90 minutes at a time. #4) Focus on the outcome, not the task at hand. : Honestly, it’s time we stopped doing things just because someone else is doing it. So often we add something to our to-do list because we think we should. Instead, start focusing on your real outcome and what’s important, then do what’s true to you and your business. Here’s a real world example, everyone and their mother has a Facebook Group these days and I can’t count the number of times I’ve been told to create one. I’m so glad I didn’t because A) I didn’t want to and B) There is now a term called “Facebook Group Fatigue,” and very popular groups are closing because they aren’t actually improving business outcomes for business owners. Instead of jumping on the bandwagon, ask yourself how you can best achieve your outcome – i. e. get more leads, more customers, build a stronger brand presence – and then see if there is a way to get that outcome with less effort or with more enjoyment. Not sure what your outcome is? When in doubt, ask yourself “what’s my fastest path to cash?” You are running a business, after all – and businesses exist to make money. #5) Work with your natural biorhythm. : You left the 9-to-5 world for a reason – why are you still working the same hours? Start monitoring when you’re most alert, effective or creative and adjust your schedule accordingly. For instance, I’m not a morning personal and am usually slow to start my day. Mornings are good for me to do some basic housekeeping, clean out the inbox, pay bills – basic stuff that doesn’t require a ton of intelligence.   After a mid-to-late morning break for exercise or fun (in Savannah, Tuesday AM was my beach morning, every week), I come back to work in the afternoon ready for deep work. Then I’ll get sleepy and take a nap or go for a walk then start again in the evenings when I get inspired and creative. Your routine might very, but keep in mind that your brain performs best in smaller bursts. Try working in 90-minute increments for less intense work and maxing out at 4-hours of deep strategy or creative work. Tim Ferriss’ 4-Hour Workweek might be a fallacy for new entrepreneurs – but a 4-Hour workday can be very effective. #6) Follow the two day rule. : If you are like most creatives and have the tendency to put stuff off, this one is actually quite simple. One thing to understand is that it is perfectly OKAY and normal to take time off or to not feel motivated (tips for getting motivated can be found in this Positive Psychology article). But in truth, motivation is pretty useless unless you have a strong willpower. Yet, if you’re like most people, chances are you don’t. What’s worse, is afterwards, we have the tendency to beat ourselves up when we do take a break.   So the beautiful thing about following the two day rule is that it allows you to take up to two full days of doing absolutely nothing if you wish - but no more than that. While it’s good self care to take time for yourself, chances are high that you have places you want to visit and experiences you want to have.   This method allows you to take time off whenever you need to as long as you don’t take more than two consecutive days. Plus it helps you to stay focused and still be kind to yourself when you just need to take a break.   So, there you have my top six keys to success and getting shit done.

    "title": "Why I quit Remote Year",
    "body": "2017/07/18 - I hate Lisbon and I’m leaving Remote Year. I’m shocked too.  Everyone and their mother loves Lisbon. Half my merry band of digital nomads want to move here and it’s one of the prettiest cities ever. And quitting Remote Year? “You look so happy in your photos,” you say.  “How can you possibly quit?” True — I’m happier than I’ve ever been because happiness resides within &amp; isn’t contingent on circumstance. I still don’t love Lisbon, and I’m still quitting Remote Year. Before you get all judgy on me, let’s step back.  I spent more time looking for Q-tips last week than I did on my business, and “sourcing” my meals has become a daily source of frustration. Will the cafe down the street be serving lunch or did they go surfing for the day? Is the Mercado open to sell me veggies or is the shop owner hungover and sleeping in this morning? I’m far too impatient to live in a city that sets hours based on whether they feel like working.  I mean, I respect the hell out the mentality — it’s why I run my own business and teach others to do the same — but when my livelihood depends on it? Not so much.  Lisbon is a lovely place to vacation, but I’d go insane if I had to live here permanently. Also, I’m tired.  Tired of having to hold my shower head, of nearly falling to my death on the flooded bathroom floor, of having to climb over my bed to use my desk, of not being able to find a place to work because our co-working space is often too crowded or too hot… of so many other things. Which leads me into why I’m leaving Remote Year. This decision was far more complicated, but the bottom line is that I’ve learned to let go of things that no longer serve me and Remote Year has become one of those things. When I applied, I saw value in having someone handle the logistics &amp; coordination of a year of travel, and thought it would be nice to have a community to see the world with. I’m beyond grateful for the incredible friends I’ve made and the experiences I’ve had, but I didn’t spend enough time thinking about the group dynamics &amp; how it would effect me energetically. Not to mention the overhead of living life out of a suitcase, moving every month and learning a new city’s quirks.  I mean, did you know that you can’t buy garbage bags in Lisbon? Why would you, unless you lived here? And since I’m not taking advantage of most of the community or educational resources RY provides (because this isn’t what I need as a professional digital nomad) or the group social events (because I’m sober &amp; an introvert), I’m also no longer seeing the value in the service — I simply can’t justify spending $2k/mo for the luxury of occasionally having dinner with friends, even if I love them dearly.  This &amp; Lisbon images above courtesy of Jay Harrison, one of the many talented people I was lucky enough to travel with this year. I mean, if I’m going to spend a month working from cafes and sharing a mediocre Airbnb where I can’t open my bedroom &amp; bathroom doors at the same time, I can do that for a lot less, and fly somewhere to meet friends for dinner. The stories I’ve gathered over the last six-months are priceless and I wouldn’t change a thing.  Except maybe the time I got a parasite after being splashed in the face with street water. Or the time I went on a Tinder date with a psychopath. Or maybe the time I found out I got the wrong treatment for Rabies and might be dying a horrifying death any second. That was a bad f*cking day. Okay, I guess I would change a few things… but these stories will be my favorite to share in years to come, and I’m thankful to have shared them with a great group of people. I’m also looking forward to new friends and memories to come — because leaving Remote Year doesn’t mean my ‘remote year’ ends.  In fact, I’m having a hard time imagining going back to the US permanently. I’ve always felt I was born on the wrong continent and the more time I spend traveling, the more I wonder if it’s true. More on that later… I don’t know exactly where I’ll end up, but then again, I suppose we never really know where life will take us.  I certainly didn’t see myself here a year ago. I’m looking at a month in sexy Barcelona, then regrouping in the UK, which feels like a second home. Beyond that? Your guess is as good as mine. Any suggestions? Crossposted on Medium "

    "title": "Remote Year Fear",
    "body": "2016/10/19 - With less than three months until I depart with Remote Year, I find myself overwhelmed by daily decisions, much less life altering decisions such as “who will be renting my apartment,” or “how am I going to survive without Amazon Prime?” I’m thrilled and excited and know that this is an opportunity of a lifetime, but I find myself questioning whether I’m ready. Mainly, I wonder if I’m capable of growing my business while abroad. I second-guess myself and my skills daily, but then I remember that the worst thing that can happen is I fail. I fail miserably and end up broke and have to scrape together funds to come home. But, oh the lessons I will have learned in the meantime! (more) So, for now, in between mild panic attacks, I’m spending time getting inspired.  This week I attended the Giant UX conference in Charlotte and was reminded why I love being a freelance UX designer so much, how design impacts our daily lives and that design really can change lives. I remembered how much I love to help companies grow and that I totally geek out about good UX design and startups. I’m looking into joining the UX designers group at Toptal, so I might find more companies to help, and I signed up as a mentor at UX for Change. All in all, a pretty good week. Lastly, I’ve come to realize that my greatest limitation is my self-doubt, fear and my tendency to compare myself to others.  I’ve known this for awhile, but this week it was hammered home repeatedly that I need to share more. My skills, my experience, my work… and the introvert in me hates that. Yes, I desperately want to share the knowledge I’ve amassed in the hopes of helping others, but I also hate people paying attention to me. And I know that I want need to share my remote year experiences as they happen — through writing and photography.  So, this post is a first step in putting my thoughts out there again and starting to practice vulnerability. Next month I’ll be traveling to San Jose, California to attend a Tony Robbins event and I’m hopeful that I’ll be even more inspired to shine and to share. If “The Giant” can’t inspire me to stop holding myself back, who can? How do you deal with feelings of overwhelm? How do you stay on course when you feel lost at sea? I’d love to hear your strategies in the comments. Update: July 2017: Since this post I’ve been to multiple Tony Robbins events, was rejected from Toptal and changed my entire career when I found my purpose, and traveled with Remote Year for six-months before quitting. I still deal with overwhelm on a regular basis and I’ve been terrible at sharing my experiences so far… but I’m working on it Crossposted on Medium "

    "title": "Shelf-help: 7 Must Read Books for Personal Growth",
    "body": "2015/01/05 - As an introvert, I have a tendency to get lost in books. It’s one of my greatest pleasures to spend a couple hours reading. In fact, during a recent four-day cruise, I read six books cover to cover. While I’m a huge fan of legal and crime thrillers, I almost always have a self-improvement or career advice book in rotation as well. I have absorbed a lot of knowledge through books, but I’ve recently realized that I’m not likely to share this knowledge outside of a directed conversation. And I want to change that. Because what’s the point of having knowledge if you keep it to yourself? I believe the trick to most self-help books is timing and personal receptivity, but maybe one of these books will change your life, or at least your perspective. The Artist’s Way: The Artist’s Way contains a number of activities and insights aimed at getting “unstuck” creatively by letting go… of negative self-talk, of preconceived notions about talent, of excuses for not creating or doing or living my dreams.   I’m only on week 7 and have already seen incredible results. The quality of my work has increased ten-fold and I’m spending more time than ever living a creative life. It’s doubtful I would have started this blog without this book, or be participating in a Project 52. This book was recommended to me multiple-times and I always dismissed it. Ultimately, I’m glad I did, because as mentioned above, I believe receptivity is the key to any self-help book. If I had read The Artist’s Way 5-years ago, I probably would have written it off it a new age, hippy, touchy-feely book. It totally is, but it’s also life altering. The 4-Hour Workweek: I’ll be honest - Timothy Ferriss strikes me as kind of of dick, and this book sometimes feels like a pyramid marketing scheme. It’s also one of the best resources I’ve come across for setting life goals, defining personal values and reframing my definition of wealth. I’ve implemented a number of incremental changes from this book during the last 6 months and have seen excellent results in my overall happiness and a reduction in hours worked.  I absolutely love my job and have no intentions to quit, but thanks to this book, I will be testing “location-independence” by spending February in Savannah. In a nutshell, 4HWW is a guide to defining what you want from life, setting clear goals and applying The Pareto Principle to everything that you do. I’ve been revisiting this one as I set my intentions for 2015. Happy Dreamlining. I Thought It Was Just Me (but it isn’t): Making the Journey from “What Will People Think?” to “I Am Enough”: I have a stage-5 girl crush on Dr. Brene Brown. If you haven’t seen her TED Talks on Vulnerability, watch them now.  I’m serious. This book list will be here when you get back. I am a recovering perfectionist who spent a lot of my life avoiding things out of shame and fear. Brown’s talks, and this book, were turning points in my ability to let things go and believe that I am Enough. I’ve read every one of her books but this one hit me the hardest. Daring Greatly is a great 2nd choice, as it is a culmination of her previous books. Secrets of Six-Figure Women: Surprising Strategies to Up Your Earnings and Change Your Life: I stumbled on this book during a on trip to Boston a few years ago. I was between jobs at the time, and considering my next steps. Did I want to be a designer or a product manager? Did I want to work for a non-profit and serve the greater good, or go corporate and serve my wallet? This book didn’t answer any of those questions, but instead opened me up to valuing my worth as an employee, changing my attitude about money and helped me realize that I didn’t have to make a choice between doing what I love and making money - I could do both. I now have a job a love, building a product that serves educators, and am a stones throw away from reaching the income goals I set. Play Like a Man, Win Like a Woman: What Men Know About Success that Women Need to Learn: This book was recommended to me by a highly-successful (male) manager and I feel this should be required reading for any woman that feels undervalued, stalled or confused about their career &amp; any man that works with women. So, umm, basically anyone with a job. I read this one in conjunction with Secrets of Six-Figure Women and my confidence immediately increased. I still have regular attacks of Impostor Syndrome, but they are shorter lasting since I learned the rules of the (Business) game. The Accidental Creative: How to Be Brilliant at a Moment’s Notice: I read this little gem on a plane, and while geared towards creative professionals, I believe anyone that wants to feel more inspired or less overwhelmed can learn from this book. If you fail to change the oil in your car, would you be surprised if it stops running? What about your creativity? Happiness? Energy? I used to think creative or mental blockers were natural (or because I wasn’t good enough - that’s shame talking), but now I see that my “not feeling it” is usually because I’ve stopped taking care of myself and stopped doing the things that energize me. I chose to highlight the Accidental Creative because I think it’s a great foundation for reframing views on nurturing ‘natural talents,’ but the authors second book, Die Empty: Unleash Your Best Work Every Day is arguably more inspiring for me. After reading this, I’ve started every day by asking “What’s the single most important thing I need to do today to create value?” Try it sometime. Manage Your Day-to-Day: Build Your Routine, Find Your Focus, and Sharpen Your Creative Mind: I think I actually read this on the same flight as The Accidental Creative. I don’t remember where I was going, but clearly that was a great flight. Manage Your Day is a super fast and fun read, with contributions from all sorts of creative and successful people, and is mainly focused on increasing productivity by clarifying priorities and reducing overwhelm. A theme in my life was “busy” for a very long time, and this book really helped me to start seeing the power of minimizing distractions and doing important things first. Honorable Mention:  Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman’s Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia Mentioned because I pretty much plagiarized the title for my last Blog. I picked up EPL while traveling in Korea and it planted a seed in my mind about the possibility of transforming my life &amp; travel as a lifestyle, as well as piquing my interest in Bali. It only took me six-years to get there.  Alcoholics Anonymous I couldn’t very well talk about life changing books without mentioning The Big Book. If you are even remotely concerned you might have a drinking problem, read the first six paragraphs of “More About Alcoholism”. If you relate, well, I have some bad news for you…What are your most influential books? I’m learning that everyone has a completely unique set of skills, knowledge and experience and we all view things through different lenses - if you’ve read any of the above, I’d love to hear about your experience.
