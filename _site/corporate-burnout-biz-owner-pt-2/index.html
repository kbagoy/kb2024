<p>This is part two of a three post series sharing my story of recovering from corporate burnout. Missed Part One? <a href="https://katebagoy.com/corporate-burnout-biz-owner-pt-1/">Read it here</a>.</p>

<p>PART II: MAKE BETTER DECISIONS</p>

<p>In 2014 I took I life changing trip to Bali and Cambodia. It was a vacation from that last dream job, which was taking over my life, and starting to kill my spirit again.</p>

<p>During the 1,000 flight to Siem Reap, I read The 4-Hour Work Week and, for the first time, it clicked in my head that there was a whole other way to live.</p>

<p>There was no reason I needed to be in a cubicle, or an office at all, and no reason to work 40-hours a week, every single week, for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>I saw possibilities I hadn’t seen before, and an entire world opened for me.</p>

<p>So often, we’re taught to settle for mediocrity: get a decent job, work hard, be a decent person, and get rewarded with your mediocre retirement plan.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, it wasn’t enough.</p>

<p><em><strong>I was DONE settling.</strong></em></p>

<p>On the same trip, I visited Angkor Wat. It was around 4,000 degrees outside, and the air was liquid it was so humid, so I had the place to myself, save for a handful of tourists and monks.</p>

<p>I climbed to the top of the sacred temple and came to a window that looked out into blue skies, lush jungle and the quiet sounds of nature.</p>

<p>As I approached the window, I burst into tears as waves of joy washed over me.</p>

<p>I was overcome with an intense wave of peace, love and belonging. I felt whole. Connected.</p>

<p>I still get chills thinking about it.</p>

<p><strong><em>I decided then and there to change my life, again.</em></strong></p>

<p>I decided I would travel more and inspire others – to live their passion, to lead happier lives, to stop living to work, to question the status quo…</p>

<p>I particularly wanted to serve women like me. I wanted to inspire women to feel happy, healthy, and fulfilled. To know they were enough, just as they were.</p>

<p><strong>These weren’t dreams. They were decisions.</strong></p>

<p>I wasn’t concerned with “how” – I knew I’d get there – I just had to start.</p>

<p>To manifest these decisions, I made more big changes in my life.</p>

<p>I got really clear on how I was spending my time, money and energy. I began cutting out things that weren’t important. I started taking care of my body and getting medical treatment for what would later be diagnosed as an endocrine disorder.</p>

<p>I had to make massive changes, again, and it was <em>so</em> hard.</p>

<p>But it was these moments – the revelations in my travel, my committed decisions, and my making tradeoffs as an entrepreneur – that have landed me where I am, living a life I deeply love.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“It’s your decisions, not your conditions, that determine your destiny” Tony Robbins</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Every choice we make as entrepreneurs have impact on our lives and livelihood.</strong></p>

<p>The right choices matter. And nearly everything in life is a choice.</p>

<p>So often, I talk to people who claim to want to make a change in their lives but fail repeatedly.</p>

<p>It’s not because they don’t want it.</p>

<p>It’s not because they can’t do it.</p>

<p><strong>9 times out of 10, it’s because they <em>cannot or will not</em> prioritize.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Instead of investing time into their business, they spend hours scrolling through Facebook.</li>
  <li>Instead of investing money in their business, they blow it on shoes or the newest Prada bag.</li>
  <li>Instead of continuing to make a little progress each day, they lose momentum and give up.</li>
  <li>Instead of taking care of themselves, they give all of their energy away to others.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>We have to decide to stop doing the things that hurt us and make better decisions.</strong></p>

<p>For me, I had to give up shopping as a hobby and weekly trips to Target. I had to budget funds to pay debt and save for travel. I had to cut out gluten and reduce my sugar and take supplements and go to meetings and physical therapy and acupuncture and learn to meditate.</p>

<p>I had to question all of the things I knew to be true.</p>

<p>I was living in Portland, Oregon where you can literally go weeks without seeing the sun and I was pretty over it, so I got permission from my then boss to work remotely and spend winter in the South.</p>

<p>I started blogging again and created the foundation for what’s now my coaching business, though I didn’t know it at the time.</p>

<p>After two months in Charleston and Savannah, I found myself crying all the way home – through the entire five hour flight – and knew something was wrong. It was crazy to move across country and so I fought the idea for a year, tried to come up with alternate plans that were rational.</p>

<p>Then I visited Savannah again and felt home. So I moved across country by myself.</p>

<p>It was one of the best decisions I ever made, even if I only stayed a year.</p>

<p><strong>That was when I learned to trust my gut and follow my heart over everything else.</strong></p>

<p>And was a catalyst for quitting that last dream job and making new decisions.</p>
