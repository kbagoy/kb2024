    <p>Hey guys!</p>

<p>This month, I am celebrating my four-year anniversary as a business owner (this is totally something to be celebrated!) and I’m coming off 2-years of travel as a digital nomad.</p>

<p>I thought I’d share a few tips on how to get started if this is your dream too.</p>

<p><em><strong>I really got started as a business owner just because I wanted to work from home and to travel more.</strong></em></p>

<p>Initially, I started working remotely for my company, but I quickly realized that <strong>what I actually wanted was to be my own boss</strong>…</p>

<p>So I quit the job, started freelancing, moved across country to Savannah and loved working from home, taking Tuesdays off to go to the beach and making my own rules.</p>

<p>Then an opportunity to join <a href="http://www.remoteyear.com/general-application?referee=5132575">Remote Year</a> came about.</p>

<p>I’d already dabbled a little with traveling a few months at a time, when I <strong>working remotely</strong> - but this was a chance to experience the world in a way that most people will never experience.</p>

<p><strong>I wanted to be a digital nomad</strong>. And an entrepreneur.</p>

<p>And thus my coaching business was born, around the same time I kicked off 2 years of full-time travel in more than 20 countries.</p>

<p>It’s not been an easy journey - in fact, it’s been some of the most challenging two years of my life - but also the most rewarding.</p>

<p><strong>So, if you’re thinking about starting a business, traveling as a nomad or making any other major life changes, here are a few things you can do:</strong></p>

<h3 id="step-1---get-inspired"><strong>Step 1 - Get Inspired</strong></h3>

<p>Way before Remote Year even existed, I read a book called <em>The 4-Hour Workweek</em>. I’m sure you’ve heard of it.</p>

<p>In the book, Tim outlines a process he calls “Dreamlining,” in which you think about all the things you could possibly want and what it might really take to acquire them.</p>

<p>Maybe thats starting a business, maybe that’s using your salary to take private jets, maybe that’s retiring at 30.</p>

<p>The idea is the same - learn to optimize your life and business - like cutting out meetings you don’t need, decisions you shouldn’t have to deal with, etc. - in order to maximize your results.</p>

<p><em><strong>Do the 20% of stuff you really NEED to do, in order to get 80% of the results you WANT.</strong></em></p>

<p>It’s a great book (that and <em>Vagabonding</em> by Rolf Potts have basically become “Nomad Bibles”), not so much for the realism of starting a business and working 4-hours a week (not likely for many early on), but because Tim opened a lot of eyes to what was POSSIBLE.</p>

<p><strong>Being INSPIRED to what you COULD have, is a great way to decide what you really want.</strong></p>

<p><em>So, start visualizing your life the way you’d really like it.</em></p>

<p>What does your day look like? Your week? Your house? Do want to find a great job, or are you keen on starting a business? Where do you work?</p>

<p>Pretend you’re in Kindergarten and daydream for a bit.</p>

<p><strong>Believe it or not, creating a vision for your life (and/or business) is actually a really powerful tool.</strong></p>

<p>I encourage to to spend a few moments thinking about what you really want to manifest for yourself this year. Then look at your current life.</p>

<p><em>How far away are you from what you want? What’s a simple thing you could do today to get a little closer to your dream?</em></p>

<p>Do it or schedule it.</p>

<h3 id="step-2---decide--prioritize"><strong>Step 2 - Decide &amp; Prioritize</strong></h3>

<p>Want to change your life?</p>

<p><em><strong>Start by making a decision, committing to making it happen and then doing the work.</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>It really is as simple as that.</strong></p>

<p>You already thought about what you wanted, now it’s time to COMMIT.</p>

<p><em>You’ve been dreaming about starting a business so you can travel or have more time?</em></p>

<p>Great! A lot of people do.</p>

<p>But are you ready to commit?</p>

<p><strong><em>Are you willing to work everyday to turn your dream into a goal?</em></strong></p>

<p>Are you prepared to say no to anything that is going to take your attention and energy away from that goal?</p>

<p>Think about it long and hard.</p>

<p>And if the answer still is yes…</p>

<p><strong>Congratulations! You’ve made it to Step One of starting a business!</strong></p>

<p><em>This seems stupid simple, but it’s actually the hardest step that most people never take.</em></p>

<p>Which is why so many people are living live by default - working their 9-to-5 til they are all wrinkly, looking back at opportunities lost and regretting they were too scared to actually <em>make a decision</em>.</p>

<h3 id="step-3---take-action--figure-it-out-as-you-go"><strong>Step 3 - Take Action &amp; Figure It Out As You Go</strong></h3>

<p>Once you’ve figured out what you wanted, made your decision and committed to making it happen - <strong>it’s time to ACT</strong>.</p>

<p>When I decided I wanted to travel more, I committed to taking at least 1 international trip per year and a couple domestic trips, and I knew I would somehow use my experience to inspire other people to change their lives.</p>

<p>I didn’t know exactly what that would look like, but I started taking action anyway.</p>

<p><em><strong>I started a blog. I started a freelance business. I started sharing more. I started planning trips when I had extra money. I started minimizing my “stuff” and cutting expenses so that I could travel even more. I decided to start another business. I hired a business coach. I started reading a book a week… yada yada yada.</strong></em></p>

<p><em>Less than two years later I was living out of a suitcase, traveling the world as nomad and working as coach.</em></p>

<p>All because I <strong>made a decision</strong>, <strong>committed</strong> to working my butt off, <strong>and took action</strong>.</p>

<p>And I continue to do that every.damn.day.</p>

<p><em>So, what do you want?</em></p>

<p><strong>Make a commitment to making it happen. Do something about it today - no more excuses.</strong></p>

<p>You’ve got this!</p>

<p>XOXO,</p>

<p>P.S. If starting a freelance business that’ll let you travel the world is on YOUR manifest list this year, I want to invite you to <a href="https://go.katebagoy.com/ebook"><strong>check out my Ebook</strong></a> that covers what you need to know to put your plan into action. </p>
