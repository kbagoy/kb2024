    <p>Want to learn how to how to make six figures as a freelancer? Meet the creative pros who’ve done it in the Six Figure Freelancers Expert Series!</p>

<p><strong>This week we bring you a digital interview Becca Kennedy of <a href="https://www.beccakennedy.net/">beccakennedy.net</a>, a Psychologist, Design Consultant &amp; UX Designer</strong>.</p>

<p>Becca turned independent and co-founded a UX consulting company called Kennason in 2015 out of Albany, NY. Currently, Becca is the UX Designer for Agrilyst, an agriculture-tech startup based in Brooklyn.</p>

<h3 id="what-makes-becca-a-six-figure-freelancer"><strong>What makes Becca a Six Figure Freelancer?</strong></h3>

<p>I’m an expert in my own experiences and my own unique combination of skills. My expertise continues to evolve because I am always learning and trying new things, so the term “UX” doesn’t quite cover it all, but it’s the closest thing!</p>

<p>Maybe what makes me stand out is that I stay on this roller coaster — I keep improving both my UX skills and my knowledge about running a business.</p>

<p>I have a lot in common with fellow freelancers who struggle. My mistakes continue to teach me as much as my successes do.</p>

<p><em><strong>Part of the reason you can call me a Six Figure Expert is that I stay on this roller coaster — I keep improving both my UX skills and my knowledge about running a business.</strong></em></p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5GsLpRmeOKE" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe>

<h3 id="what-can-you-tell-our-readers-about-your-background">What can you tell our readers about your background?</h3>

<p>I came from academia and eventually moved to consulting. I’m from upstate New York, and straight after college I was accepted to a PhD program in Human Factors Psychology and moved to Norfolk, Virginia.</p>

<p>I worked in a university lab where we studied cognitive issues in surgery, and we researched and tested simulators designed to help train surgical teams. A few years into that program, in about 2011, I realized that User Experience (UX) was an area of design that used many of the same concepts from Human Factors.</p>

<p>Alongside my PhD work, I started peeking into UX conferences and meetups and realized I had a lot more fun there.</p>

<p>My PhD program was grueling, like most PhD programs are. Financially, I also lived off a modest stipend for those years. So, after I spent five years on graduate coursework, research contracts, and PhD qualifying exams, I reached a personal breaking point and I moved to Albany to undertake my dissertation remotely.</p>

<p><em>I don’t talk about this very often, but I was burned out and broke and emotionally crushed and wanted to live somewhere I love.</em></p>

<p>The first and only Human Factors job I found locally was a research staff position at an engineering college, which was not ideal for what I wanted, but I applied and accepted it.</p>

<p>After getting my bearings in Albany by attending a ton of events and meeting people, I decided to start a UX design business with two partners.</p>

<p>I’d realized that since I’d decided to make Albany, a small city, my permanent home, the only way I would be happy with my career is if I created my own.</p>

<h3 id="how-long-have-you-been-in-business-and-what-inspired-you-to-start-you-business">How long have you been in business and what inspired you to start you business?</h3>

<p>I’d actually wanted to start a business for about five years before it happened.</p>

<p>I’d very casually talked with people who had started UX companies to find out how it worked.</p>

<p>My loose plan was to finish my PhD and then work a cool job for a bit first, but that’s not what happened.</p>

<p>I co-founded the business while I was still working on my PhD dissertation. I really jumped in because of a need for money and a desire to do something huge to kickstart things.</p>

<p>In a way it was nice, because I never left a cushy job or great benefits for my venture. I was already used to living on little income and working really hard.</p>

<p>So, it’s been slowly uphill from there.</p>

<p>I’m really grateful for a career I can control and I’m grateful for the amount of stuff I learned in my 20s while I was really scrappy and falling on my face.</p>

<h3 id="what-specifically-do-you-do-who-do-you-work-with-and-where">What, specifically, do you do? Who do you work with and where?</h3>

<p>I’m a User Experience (UX) Researcher and Designer. I’m also a Human Factors Psychologist.</p>

<p>That means I use my expertise inhuman cognition and behavior to inform product design. My ideal clients are startups and small businesses who are passionate about solving problems and doing social good.</p>

<p>I’m based in Albany, NY, but my clients can be almost anywhere! I work from home and I love it.</p>

<p>I really like working with clients who are starting a UX process from scratch. I like teaching others how to use research methods and human-centered design thinking.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-your-top-piece-of-advice-related-to-your-area-of-expertise">What is your top piece of advice related to your area of expertise?</h3>

<p>Designing good experiences means you have to get to know users or customers.</p>

<p>If you aren’t actually researching and talking to these people, you really are not fully doing human-centered design.</p>

<p>That being said, there are a lot of things like web accessibility that are just good practice and don’t involve user research.</p>

<p>Another big tip is that UX is not only about digital products — this is a recent assumption because a lot of designers started working in UX from web and software design, but experiences can be physical products or spaces, too!</p>

<h3 id="how-did-you-get-started-in-business-what-are-the-first-steps-you-took">How did you get started in business? What are the first steps you took?</h3>

<p>I got started with zero business knowledge. And I really mean zero. It’s almost embarrassing!</p>

<p>I had been deep in academia, which is a totally different world. I learned a lot through trial and error and fighting for learning opportunities.</p>

<p>I am still learning all the time.</p>

<p>I really recommend taking some kind of entrepreneur boot camp, if you can. I did this recently and I wish I had done it when I was first starting a UX design business.</p>

<p>My boot camp was two evenings per week for a few months. It was offered by my local Chamber ofCommerce. Take advantage of affordable resources around you!</p>

<p>And don’t be embarrassed like I was about how little you might know upfront. If you are passionate about what you are doing, you will learn!</p>

<p><em>You have to jump in and start trying things to really get anywhere.</em></p>

<h3 id="how-did-you-get-first-client--how-did-you-get-your-best-client">How did you get first client &amp; how did you get your best client?</h3>

<p>The answer to both is word of mouth! I’ve gotten a lot of work from having positive relationships with others who work in my field or complementary fields.</p>

<h3 id="what-marketing-strategies-have-been-most-effective-for-you">What marketing strategies have been most effective for you?</h3>

<p>I’m not huge on marketing tricks, but what works for me is writing helpful or informative articles about UX (I am a writer for What UsersDo, which was recently acquired by UserZoom) and giving talks and workshops at conferences and events.</p>

<p>By sharing pieces of my expertise, I am building trust with others and low-key promoting myself.</p>

<p>Some of my best leads have come from people who have seen me speak publicly.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-stay-motivated-or-deal-with-fear-or-stress">How do stay motivated or deal with fear or stress?</h3>

<p>It can honestly be really hard to deal with fear, stress, and setbacks.</p>

<p>I suggest making friends with other freelancers and consultants, and genuinely support one another.</p>

<p>When you need to take a break, try to take a break.</p>

<p>Your physical and mental health are important and taking care of yourself is beneficial for your business in the long run.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-you-stand-out-from-the-competition-what-do-you-to-differentiate-yourself-from-other-people-in-your-area-of-expertise">How do you stand out from the competition? What do you to differentiate yourself from other people in your area of expertise?</h3>

<p>One thing that sets me apart is that I’ve been doing Human Factors and UX work for over 10 years, which is actually quite a longtime compared to many UX Designers. Although UX comes from a history of other disciplines, UX as a buzzword is still really young!</p>

<h3 id="what-are-your-top-tips-for-people-thinking-of-quitting-a-job-to-start-a-business">What are your top tips for people thinking of quitting a job to start a business?</h3>

<p>Definitely know that there will be huge ups and huge downs. A support system of others who are in similar shoes to yours is critical, in my opinion!</p>

<p>And of course, try to keep your expenses down and try to have some savings in place before striking out.</p>

<p>Some things, like having a website ready, can be done while you’re still working your job.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-you-favorite-book-blog-podcast-or-other-resource-and-why">What is you favorite book, blog, podcast or other resource and why?</h3>

<p>I really recommend UX Team of One by Leah Buley! I also find Amy Poehler’s book “Yes, Please” to be pretty inspirational and fun, so I think I’ve read that three times.</p>

<h3 id="what-business-tool-or-online-software-could-you-not-live-without-what-makes-it-easy-to-run-your-business">What business tool or online software could you not live without? What makes it easy to run your business?</h3>

<p>Honestly, Twitter and Slack are my world.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-you-like-most-about-running-your-own-business">What do you like most about running your own business?</h3>

<p>I love choosing the companies that I get to work with, and I like having the flexibility of working from home.</p>

<h3 id="whats-next-for-your-business-what-do-you-have-planned-for-the-next-year-or-what-big-goals-are-you-tracking-on">What’s next for your business? What do you have planned for the next year, or what big goals are you tracking on?</h3>

<p>These days I am working in a full-time role that I stumbled upon at just the right time, and I love it! I also work on small consulting projects and I do freelance writing for UserZoom.</p>

<p>Right now, I enjoy that I can pick and choose meaningful clients and these clients give me extra income. I really needed this kind of security after a bunch of years in grad school and then consulting.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I’m continuing to learn new skills and slowly increase my value and rate, so that when I eventually return to consulting full time someday, I’ll be way leveled up.</p>

<h3 id="what-else-is-important-that-we-havent-asked">What else is important that we haven’t asked?</h3>

<p>Just keep swimming.</p>
