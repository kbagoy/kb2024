<p>I don‚Äôt know who needs to hear this, but..</p>

<p><strong>You have the right to change your mind.</strong></p>

<p>Okay, it was me. I needed to hear this.</p>

<p>But just for funsies, repeat after me:</p>

<p><em><strong>‚ÄúI have the right to change my mind.‚Äù</strong></em></p>

<p>You are not obligated to keep doing things that aren‚Äôt working for you in order to impress, inspire or get the approval of anyone else.</p>

<p>You have ONE little lifetime in your current human suit, so you might as well do more of what you love!</p>

<p><em>Letting go of something that isn‚Äôt working for you is a win, not a failure.</em></p>

<p>This is what I‚Äôve been telling myself for the last few week as I contemplated dropping a big bomb on my clients, my audience, my friends‚Ä¶</p>

<p>See, every once in a while I like to burn things to the ground so I can rise like a Phoenix from the ashes.</p>

<p>Now is one of those times, so here goes:</p>

<p><em><strong>I‚Äôve decided to exit the coaching business.</strong></em></p>

<p>**GASP**</p>

<p>Hold-up don‚Äôt leave yet! I‚Äôm not shuttering completely, just hear me out.</p>

<p>First, the why.</p>

<p>Long story short‚Ä¶</p>

<p>2020 hit me like a metric ton of bricks.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not gonna go into details, but it was a FANTASTIC opportunity to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Practice letting go of things I can‚Äôt control</li>
  <li>Deal with childhood trauma &amp; self-defeating BS</li>
  <li>Evaluate my priorities</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>I was starting to feel more excited and clear about my life &amp; business than I ever had before and started making HUGE plans.</em></strong></p>

<p>Then, I got the covid.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve had symptoms for over 7 months now, and while I‚Äôm much better today, I completely lost momentum in my business.</p>

<p><em>Turns out if you don‚Äôt market yourself or can‚Äôt take on clients, a coaching practice is a bitch to keep running.</em></p>

<p>More importantly, I realized I‚Äôm no longer interested in doing what I was doing before I got sick.</p>

<p>[bctt tweet=‚ÄùI got into business to help people, but somewhere along the way I became a marketer.‚Äù username=‚Äùkbagoy‚Äù]</p>

<p><strong>I got into business to help people, but somewhere along the way I became a marketer.</strong></p>

<p>I became obsessed with growth hacking and funnel design and traffic generation and capturing keywords.</p>

<p>While I‚Äôm pretty good at it, and it‚Äôs an important part of growing a business, it‚Äôs not how I want to live on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Sure, I could hire a team, but as an introvert, I don‚Äôt want to build or run a big company‚Ä¶ nor do I want to be on video calls 10-20 hours per week. I want more time to rest &amp; create in quiet.</p>

<p>So, I‚Äôm going back to product design &amp; pivoting my brand.</p>

<p>I still want to help people, particularly people starting businesses, but not as a full-time coach.</p>

<p>For now, I‚Äôm focused on finding a freelance or contract role, but I‚Äôm even open to FT for the 1st time in years.</p>

<p>Having some killer healthcare coverage doesn‚Äôt sound like a bad thing after the last 6-months! Plus, <strong>after 5-years of self-employment, I honestly miss having a team to work with!</strong></p>

<p><em>I miss working on projects that have a deadline and taking a week off where I don‚Äôt think about work. I miss collaborating with other designers &amp; product people, and celebrating launches over tacos.</em></p>

<p>But I felt some shame around sharing this with you.</p>

<p>I mean, my entire brand is based around thriving financially and how to ‚Äúdesign a life &amp; business you love.‚Äù</p>

<p>Now I‚Äôm telling ya I‚Äôm not so much loving my biz, nor thriving financially.</p>

<p>ü§£ü§£ü§£</p>

<p><em>But‚Ä¶ I guess, in a weird way, this is my way of talking the talk and walking the walk.</em></p>

<p>I‚Äôve gotten clarity around what I want, and I‚Äôm taking action.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs scary. It‚Äôs uncertain. But I know it‚Äôs the right thing for me.</p>

<p><em>I have the right to change my mind.</em></p>

<p><strong>Here‚Äôs what you can expect over the next few months:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Six Figure Freelancers will be relaunching later this year as 6FF Pro, and that will be where most of my energy will be focused.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll be leading group coaching calls each month, adding more trainings, and bringing in experts for skills training.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm behind due to my energy issues, but if you want to be part of our first group <a href="http://sixfigurefreelancers.com/waitlist">you can join the waitlist here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Once the launch is done, my part-time hobby will be creating passive income streams - and more content for you!</p>

<p>In fact, I‚Äôve just completed the design on a planner for entrepreneurs that combines techniques from my morning routine, favorite productivity techniques and a bunch of woo-woo stuff I‚Äôve gotten into the last few years, like Law of Attraction.</p>

<p>It‚Äôll be up on Amazon soon so stay tuned!</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> As I figure my ish out, I‚Äôm offering instant booking sessions on SuperPeer and for a limited time I‚Äôve added donation-based coaching.</p>

<p>My scheduled will change as I take on design work, so go ahead and <a href="https://superpeer.com/kbagoy">fill my calendar up while you can</a>, I dare ya!</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> I want to bring in experts to teach skills to the 6FF Pro community on a monthly or quarterly basis. Stuff like generating passive income, growth hacking, copywriting, design‚Ä¶ anything helpful to a micro-business owner.</p>

<p>If that‚Äôs you, <a href="/contact">get in touch</a> and let me know what you‚Äôd want to teach on for an hour - you‚Äôll get a little bit of cash, some street cred, an invite to become an affiliate partner and a lot of love from me.</p>

<p><strong>5.</strong> We‚Äôll be updating katebagoy.com to reflect our new focus, but we‚Äôre dedicated to adding more content and resources for you.</p>

<p>If you have a requested topic you‚Äôd like me to cover, reach out. And please be patient -¬† I apologize in advance if I break something and you get a pesky 404 error</p>

<p><strong>Finally, if you‚Äôre still reading‚Ä¶ thank you!</strong></p>

<p>I imagine you‚Äôve probably been following me (&amp; all my mis-adventure) for awhile if you‚Äôve made it this far.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt know exactly how this pivot is gonna play out, but but I hope you stick around to watch the story unfold.</p>

<p>XOXO,</p>

<p>Kate</p>
