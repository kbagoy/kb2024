    <p>Freelance work has become more popular, but for many people, it can still be an unfamiliar idea. While there are a lot of upsides to working as a normal employee, there are some benefits that come from being a freelancer that you aren’t going to find in a normal job that can make up for some of the stress that comes from working freelance.</p>

<h2 id="create-your-own-schedule"><strong>Create Your Own Schedule</strong></h2>

<p>As a freelancer, you are answerable only to yourself and the deadlines that you set when scheduling your projects with your clients. This allows you <a href="https://blog.xolo.io/how-to-create-an-optimal-work-schedule-as-a-freelancer">to set your own schedule</a> and work at whatever time works best for you. Some people find they are more productive at different times of day, so experiment with different schedules to see what works best for you. </p>

<p>You can also take a break if you need to relax or run errands, without worrying that your boss will notice that you aren’t at work. It is important to actually set aside time to work though. If you don’t, you run the risk of putting it off until the last minute and either missing deadlines or rushing the job.</p>

<h2 id="reduce-your-taxes"><strong>Reduce Your Taxes</strong></h2>

<p>As a self-employed freelancer, you are required to file taxes as a business owner in order to stay on the right side of the IRS. However, there are things that you can do to reduce the amount of taxes that you have to pay. Keep track of what you are paying for and using for your business. For instance, if you have to drive to meet with clients, you can deduct some of those costs as a business expense. </p>

<p>You can also invest some of your income in your own retirement accounts. A <a href="https://www.planperfectretirement.com/sep-vs-401k/">SEP-IRA lets you make tax-deductible contributions</a> of 20% of your net income. Because of the deductions you are able to make, you are likely to end up paying fewer taxes than a normal employee who makes the same gross amount as you.</p>

<h2 id="enjoy-your-work"><strong>Enjoy Your Work</strong></h2>

<p>One of the biggest struggles that people have with work is <a href="https://www.tomedes.com/translator-hub/being-freelancer-makes-you-happier-person.php">figuring out how to enjoy</a> what they are spending their time doing. However, if you are freelancing, that means you get to choose what you are doing, which allows you to turn your passions into your career. This doesn’t mean it is easy by any stretch of the imagination, but it does mean that you are unlikely to hate your job or feel uninspired. This is one of the biggest benefits of working freelance. Combined with the ability to set your own schedule, you can easily find a way to live a life that you love.</p>

<p>In addition to these benefits, working as a freelancer opens up your earning potential to anything you are willing to work for. It takes hard work and a lot of dedication, but there is always a way to be successful at what you love doing.</p>
