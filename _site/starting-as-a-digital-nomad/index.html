    <p>Here’s what you need to know… and a bit of a rant, really, for anyone thinking of hiring a coach, joining a group or starting a business. I’m a business coach, and I’m location independent, and I tend to work with people who want the same lifestyle. But I don’t call myself a “location-independent business coach” because, well, there are a lot of douchebags out there who are calling themselves coaches, but in reality know Jack and Sh!t about business. The digital nomad lifestyle seems to be THE new hotness right now and the market is saturated with people offering courses in how to be a digital nomad… Something no one over the age of 10 needs a course for. <strong>The people putting out these courses are often (no, not always) people who had no business experience before starting their info-product business on how to be a digital nomad.</strong> Before they launched that course they were eating ramen in their dirt cheap apartment in Chiang Mai. Which means they are the LAST people you want to hire for help if you’re looking to start a profitable, long-term business. <em><strong>Basically what I’m saying is that you need to do your research if you’re going to hire a business coach.</strong></em> Make sure said coach has either built a business like the one you want to build OR has experience guiding others to get the results you want. Ensure that they have experience or certifications to back up their claims, good testimonials and that you TRUST them. Trust is key when hiring a business coach, as you will ONLY get results if you’re able to be fully honest with your coach, and willing to do what is suggested of you. As for getting started as a digital nomad, here’s the free course:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find a remote job or start a business you can run online</li>
  <li>Sell your shit and pack your bag</li>
  <li>Pick a country and book a flight</li>
  <li>Go, and don’t overstay.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>It’s really IS that easy…</em> <em><strong>What makes it hard is your fear and overthinking everything.</strong></em> Personally, I spent 6 month perfecting my packing and buying all the things… Only to get to Asia and throw half of it out. Turns out, there are stores everywhere, and no, you don’t need a year’s worth of birth control and allergy pills or 14 pairs of shoes. You don’t need that super-amazing 100 compartment case for sorting your toiletries or a suitcase with a phone charger in it. You probably should consider bringing a power strip to plug in all the electronics, and make sure your bag is under 25kgs. <em><strong>Pack light, buy local, and have fun.</strong></em> All that said and done, there is absolutely nothing wrong in investing in a life or business coach who can help you through the fear, help you get shit done when you’re travel lagged or help you figure out WTF you want to do with your life. And there are great communities &amp; travel programs out there you can join as well, like Jason + Travs <a href="//locationindie.com/">Location Indie</a>, <a href="http://www.remoteyear.com/general-application?referee=5132575">Remote Year</a>, <a href="https://app.outsite.co/c/ZTCPA6UV">Outsite</a>, <a href="https://wifitribe.co/">Wifi Tribe</a>, <a href="https://www.hackerparadise.org/">Hacker Paradise</a> or <a href="//nomadlist.com">Nomad List</a>. Just be sure to do your homework before you spend your hard earned funds on a teenager who got lucky with their course for becoming a digital nomad.
