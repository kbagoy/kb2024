Hey, I'm Kate... a travel-loving design nerd with an MBA, a tech-addiction and a penchant for fish-tacos.

Since 2008 Iâ€™ve been helping entrepreneurs build companies online as a marketer, <a href="https://killerdesignforstartups.com/"> product designer</a>, strategist, <a href="">web designer</a> and advisor. A few years ago, while traveling with Remote Year, someone asked me how they could start freelancing too - and thus an idea was born.

I wrote a book & created an <a href="https://sixfigurefreelancers.com/">online course</a> detailing how to get started as a freelancer - and I teach nearly everything I know about brand, business, marketing and mindset on this site.

I'm no longer active on social media, but if you'd like to get updates, you can grab my book <a href="">here</a>. Enjoy! ðŸ™‚
