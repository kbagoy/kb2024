THIS WEBSITES IS CONTINUALLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND SIX FIGURE FREELANCERS MAKES NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, IMPLIED OR EXPRESS, AS TO ITS ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR APPROPRIATENESS FOR ANY PURPOSE WITH REGARDS TO CONTENT RELATING TO HEALTH & WELLNESS ON THE SITE:

The WEBSITES AND JOURNAL OFFER HEALTH AND WELLNESS INFORMATION AND ARE DESIGNED FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. YOU SHOULD NOT RELY ON THIS INFORMATION AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, NOR DOES IT REPLACE, PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL ADVICE, DIAGNOSIS, OR TREATMENT. IF YOU HAVE ANY CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR HEALTH, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS CONSULT WITH A PHYSICIAN OR OTHER HEALTH-CARE PROFESSIONAL. DO NOT DISREGARD, AVOID OR DELAY OBTAINING MEDICAL OR HEALTH RELATED ADVICE FROM YOUR HEALTH-CARE PROFESSIONAL BECAUSE OF SOMETHING YOU MAY HAVE READ ON THIS SITE. THE USE OF ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THIS SITE IS SOLELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.

NOTHING STATED OR POSTED ON THIS SITE OR AVAILABLE THROUGH ANY SERVICES ARE INTENDED TO BE, AND MUST NOT BE TAKEN TO BE, THE PRACTICE OF MEDICAL OR COUNSELING CARE. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE AND COUNSELING INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, PSYCHIATRY, PSYCHOLOGY, PSYCHOTHERAPY, OR PROVIDING HEALTH CARE TREATMENT, INSTRUCTIONS, DIAGNOSIS, PROGNOSIS OR ADVICE.

WITH REGARDS TO FINANCIAL CONTENT ON THE SITE:

NEITHER SIX FIGURE FREELANCERS LLC NOR ITS OWNERS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, CONTENT PROVIDERS AND AGENTS ARE FINANCIAL ADVISERS AND NOTHING CONTAINED ON THE SITE IS INTENDED TO BE OR TO BE CONSTRUED AS FINANCIAL ADVICE.

SIX FIGURE FREELANCERS LLC DOES NOT PROVIDE PERSONALIZED FINANCIAL ADVICE OR ACT AS A FINANCIAL ADVISOR. IT EXISTS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY, AND THE MATERIALS AND INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN ARE FOR GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.

THE EDUCATION AND INFORMATION PRESENTED HEREIN IS INTENDED FOR A GENERAL AUDIENCE AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE, NOR SHOULD IT BE CONSTRUED AS, SPECIFIC ADVICE TAILORED TO ANY INDIVIDUAL. YOU ARE ENCOURAGED TO DISCUSS ANY OPPORTUNITIES WITH YOUR ATTORNEY, ACCOUNTANT, FINANCIAL PROFESSIONAL OR OTHER ADVISOR.

Commentary and other materials posted on the Websites or in our program material are not intended to amount to advice on which reliance should be placed. We therefore disclaim all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance placed on such materials by any visitor to the site or person who accesses or uses the Company’s material.

We shall have no liability for any damage caused by errors or omissions in any information, instructions or scripts provided to us by you in connection with the site or our programs, or any actions taken by us at your direction.

#### **Termination**

We may cancel or terminate your right to use the Websites or Journal or any part of the Websites or Journal at any time without notice. In the event of cancellation or termination, you are no longer authorized to access the part of the Websites or Journal affected by such cancellation or termination. The restrictions imposed on you with respect to material downloaded from the Websites or Journal, and the disclaimers and limitations of liabilities set forth in these Terms of Service, shall survive.

#### **Refund Policy**

All digital downloads, including but not limited to ebook purchases, templates or video trainings, are protected by the DCMA and are 100% non-refundable.

**By enrolling in a coaching program, you are committing to yourself, your business and to getting the support you need... therefore all your payments, including any deposit, are non-refundable after 24-hours.**

Why 24-hours? Because it would be difficult for a scammer to steal 100% of my trademarked training materials in less than a day, and I also know that EVERYONE has accidentally committed to something and then realized it was a mistake. Like the time I bought a car from Dick Hannah. That mistake is still paying off 15 years later in monthly spam & 'warranty expiration' calls.

Point is, I feel you should have *some* recourse if major buyers remorse kicks in, you accidentally overdrafted your account or suddenly decide to move to the Himalayas to study with monks.

But after a day, you've committed to yourself to a life-changing program and it's time to get to work.

Questions before you commit? Email kate@katebagoy.com and I’ll get back to you strait away.

 

#### **Other**

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under the U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by SIX FIGURE FREELANCERS infringe your copyright, you, or your agent may send to SIX FIGURE FREELANCERS a notice requesting that the material be removed or access to it be blocked. Any notification by a copyright owner or a person authorized to act on its behalf that fails to comply with requirements of the DMCA shall not be considered sufficient notice and shall not be deemed to confer upon SIX FIGURE FREELANCERS actual knowledge of facts or circumstances from which infringing material or acts are evident. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send to SIX FIGURE FREELANCERS a counter-notice. All notices and counter notices must meet the then current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright for details. SIX FIGURE FREELANCERS’s Copyright Agent for notice of claims of copyright infringement or counter notices can be reached as follows: kate@katebagoy.com.

These Terms of Service shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of SIX FIGURE FREELANCERS and our respective assigns, successors, heirs, and legal representatives. Neither these Terms of Service nor any rights hereunder may be assigned without the prior written consent of SIX FIGURE FREELANCERS Notwithstanding the foregoing, all rights and obligations under these Terms of Service may be freely assigned by SIX FIGURE FREELANCERS to any affiliated entity or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries.

#### **Dispute Resolution:**

These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware and any dispute shall be subject to binding arbitration in Dover, Delaware. If any provision of these Terms of Service shall be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms of Service and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

#### **Class Action Waiver**

You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations aren’t allowed.

The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless all relevant parties specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration.

#### **Severability**

If any clause within this Provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Provision, and the remainder of this Provision will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Provision will be unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a court.
